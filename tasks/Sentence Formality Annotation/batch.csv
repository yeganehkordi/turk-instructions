I want to share with you an awesome experience I had in the Colorado House of Representatives on May 8 . It is a humbling experience to look back and realize that God used me to play a role in His divine orchestration . I was leaving the House chambers for the weekend when our Democrat speaker of the House announced that the coming Monday would be the final day of this year &apos;s General Assembly . He went on to state that there were still numerous resolutions on the calendar which we would need to be addressed prior to the summer adjournment . Interestingly , he specifically mentioned that one of the resolutions we would be hearing was being carried by the House Majority Leader Alice Madden , honoring the 90th anniversary of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains . As a strong pro - life legislator I was disgusted by the idea that we would pass a resolution honoring this 90-year legacy of genocide . I drove home that night wondering what I could say that might pierce the darkness during the debate on this heinous resolution . On Saturday morning , I took my 8-year - old son up to the mountains to go white - water rafting . The trip lasted all day . As we were driving home , exhausted and hungry , I remembered that I had accepted an invitation to attend a fundraising dinner that night for a local pro - life organization . One of my most respected mentors had personally called me several weeks earlier and asked me to attend , so I knew I &apos; d have to clean up and head over . After our meal , the executive director of the organization introduced the keynote speaker . I looked up and saw walking to the stage a handicapped young lady being assisted to the microphone by a young man holding a guitar . Her name was Gianna Jessen . Gianna said `` Hello , &apos;&apos; welcomed everyone , and then sang three of the most beautiful Christian songs I have ever heard . She then began to give her testimony . When her biological mother was 17 years old and seven and a half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to have an abortion . As God would have it , the abortion failed and a beautiful 2-pound baby girl was brought into the world . Unfortunately , she was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors thought that she would never survive . The doctors were wrong . Imagine the timing ! A survivor of a Planned Parenthood abortion arrived in town just days before the Colorado House of Representatives was to celebrate Planned Parenthood &apos;s `` wonderful &apos;&apos; work . As I listened to Gianna &apos;s amazing testimony , the Lord inspired me to ask her if she could stay in Denver until Monday morning so that I could introduce her on the floor of the House and tell her story . Perhaps she could even begin the final day &apos;s session by singing our country &apos;s national anthem ! To my surprise she said she would seriously consider it . If she were to agree , she wanted her accompanying guitarist to stay as well . A lady standing in line behind me waiting to meet Gianna overheard our conversation and said that she would be willing to pay for the guitarist &apos;s room . Gianna then said that she would think about it . As I was driving home from the banquet , my cell phone rang . It was Gianna , and she immediately said , `` I &apos; m in , let &apos;s ruin this celebration . &apos;&apos; Praise God ! When Monday morning came , I awoke at 6 a.m. to write my speech before heading to the Capitol . As I wrote down the words , I could sense God &apos;s help and I knew that this was going to be a powerful moment for the pro - life movement . Following a committee hearing , I rushed into the House chambers just as the opening morning prayer was about to be given . Between the prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance , I wrote a quick note to the speaker of the House explaining that Gianna is an advocate for cerebral palsy . I took the note to the speaker and asked if I could have my friend open the last day of session by singing the national anthem . Without any hesitation the speaker took the microphone and said , `` Before we begin , Representative Harvey has made available for us Gianna Jessen to sing the national anthem . &apos;&apos; Gianna sang the most amazing rendition of The Star Spangled Banner that you could possibly imagine . Every person in the entire chamber was completely still , quiet and in awe of this frail young lady &apos;s voice . Due to her cerebral palsy , Gianna often loses her balance , and shortly after starting to sing she grabbed my arm to stabilize herself , and I could tell that she was shaking . Suddenly , midway through the song , she forgot the words and began to hum and then said , `` Please forgive me ; I am so nervous . &apos;&apos; She then immediately began singing again and every House member and every guest throughout the chambers began to sing along with her to give her encouragement and to lift her up . As I looked around the huge hall I listened to the unbelievable melody of Gianna &apos;s voice being accompanied by a choir of over 100 voices . I had chills running all over my body , and I knew that I had just witnessed an act of God . As the song concluded the speaker of the House explained that Gianna has cerebral palsy and is an activist to bring awareness to the disease . `` Let us give her a hand not only for her performance today , but also for her advocacy work , &apos;&apos; he said . The chamber immediately exploded into applause -- she had them all in the palm of her hand . The speaker then called the House to order , and we proceeded as usual to allow members to make any announcements or introductions of guests . For dramatic effect , I waited until I was the last person remaining before I introduced Gianna . As I waited for my turn , I nervously paced back and forth praying to God that he would give me the peace , confidence and the courage necessary to pull off what I knew would be one of the most dramatic and controversial moments of my political career . While I waited , a prominent reporter from one of the major Denver newspapers walked over to Gianna and told her that her rendition captured the spirit of the national anthem more powerfully than any she had ever heard before . Finally , I was the last person remaining . So , I proceeded to the microphone and began my speech . Members , I would like to introduce you to a new friend and hero of mine -- her name is Gianna Jessen . She is visiting us today from Nashville , Tennessee , where she is an accomplished recording artist . She has cerebral palsy and was raised in foster homes before being adopted at the age of four She was born prematurely and weighed only 2 pounds at birth . She remained in the hospital for almost three months . A doctor once said she had a great will to live and that she fought for her life . Eventually she was able to leave the hospital and be placed in foster care . Because of her cerebral palsy , her foster mother was told that it was doubtful that she would ever crawl or walk . She could not sit up independently . Through the prayers and dedication of her foster mother , she eventually learned to sit up , crawl , then stand . Shortly before her fourth birthday , she began to walk with leg braces and a walker . She continued in physical therapy and after a total of four surgeries , she was able to walk without assistance . She still falls sometimes , but she says she has learned how to fall gracefully after falling for 29 years . Two years ago , she walked into a local health club and said she wanted a private trainer . At the time her legs could not lift 30 pounds . Today she can leg press 200 pounds . She became so physically fit that she began running marathons to raise money and awareness for cerebral palsy . She just returned last week from England where she ran in the London Marathon . It took her more than eight - and-a-half hours to complete . They were taking down the course by the time she made it to the finish line . But she made it , nonetheless . With bloody feet and aching joints , she finished the race . Members would you help me recognize a modern - day hero -- Gianna Jessen ? At this point the chamber exploded into applause which lasted for 15-to-20 seconds . Gianna had touched their souls . Ironically , Alice Madden , the majority leader and sponsor of the Planned Parenthood resolution , walked over to Gianna and congratulated her . As the applause began to die down , I raised my hand to be recognized one more time . Mr. Speaker , members , if you would allow me just a few more moments I would appreciate your time . My name is Ted Harvey , not Paul Harvey , but , please , let me tell you the rest of the story . The cause of Gianna &apos;s cerebral palsy is not because of some biological freak of nature , but rather the choice of her mother . You see when her biological mother was 17-years - old and 7-and - a-half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to seek a late - term abortion . The abortionist performed a saline abortion on this 17-year - old girl . This procedure requires the injection of a high concentration of saline into the mother &apos;s womb , which the fetus is then bathed in and swallows , which results in the fetus being burned to death , inside and out . Within 24 hours the results are normally an induced , still - born abortion . As Gianna can testify , the procedure is not always 100 percent effective . Gianna is an aborted late - term fetus who was born alive . The high concentration of saline in the womb for 24 hours resulted in a lack of oxygen to her brain and is the cause of her cerebral palsy . Members , today , we are going to recognize the 90th anniversary of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood ... &apos;&apos; BANG ! The gavel came down . Just as I was finishing the last sentence of my speech -- the climax of the morning -- the speaker of the House gaveled me down and said , `` Representative Harvey , I will allow you to continue your introduction , but not for the purposes of debating a measure now pending before the House . &apos;&apos; At which point I said , `` Mr. Speaker , I understand . I just wanted to put a face to what we are celebrating today . &apos;&apos; Silence . Deafening silence . I then walked back to my chair shaking like a leaf . The Democrats would n&apos;t look at me . They were fuming . It was beautiful . I have been in the Legislature for five tough years , and this made it all worthwhile . The House majority leader would n&apos;t talk to me the rest of the day . Was it because I introduced an abortion survivor , or was it because we touched her soul ? She could congratulate an inspirational cerebral palsy victim and advocate , but was outraged when she discovered that the person she congratulated was also an abortion survivor . The headline in The Denver Post the next day read `` Abortion Jab Earns Rebuke . &apos;&apos; The majority leader is quoted as saying , `` I think it was amazingly rude to use a human being as an example of his personal politics . &apos;&apos; Yes , Representative Madden , Gianna Jessen is a human being . She was when she was in her mother &apos;s womb , and she was when she sang the national anthem on the floor of the Colorado House of Representatives . The paper went on to quote Gianna , stating she was glad I told her story . `` We need to discuss the humanity of it . I &apos; m glad to be able to speak up for children in the womb , &apos;&apos; she said . `` If abortion is about women &apos;s rights , where were my rights ? &apos;&apos; All I can say is , `` Glory to God ! &apos;&apos; He orchestrated it all , every minute of it , and I was so honored to have been chosen to play a part . May we all continue to be filled with and to fight for the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ !",,2_Moderately_Formal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,0_Neither,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,,,,,,,,,,

Members , I would like to introduce you to a new friend and hero of mine -- her name is Gianna Jessen . She is visiting us today from Nashville , Tennessee , where she is an accomplished recording artist . She has cerebral palsy and was raised in foster homes before being adopted at the age of four She was born prematurely and weighed only 2 pounds at birth . She remained in the hospital for almost three months . A doctor once said she had a great will to live and that she fought for her life . Eventually she was able to leave the hospital and be placed in foster care . Because of her cerebral palsy , her foster mother was told that it was doubtful that she would ever crawl or walk . She could not sit up independently . Through the prayers and dedication of her foster mother , she eventually learned to sit up , crawl , then stand . Shortly before her fourth birthday , she began to walk with leg braces and a walker . She continued in physical therapy and after a total of four surgeries , she was able to walk without assistance . She still falls sometimes , but she says she has learned how to fall gracefully after falling for 29 years . Two years ago , she walked into a local health club and said she wanted a private trainer . At the time her legs could not lift 30 pounds . Today she can leg press 200 pounds . She became so physically fit that she began running marathons to raise money and awareness for cerebral palsy . She just returned last week from England where she ran in the London Marathon . It took her more than eight - and-a-half hours to complete . They were taking down the course by the time she made it to the finish line . But she made it , nonetheless . With bloody feet and aching joints , she finished the race . Members would you help me recognize a modern - day hero -- Gianna Jessen ? At this point the chamber exploded into applause which lasted for 15-to-20 seconds . Gianna had touched their souls . Ironically , Alice Madden , the majority leader and sponsor of the Planned Parenthood resolution , walked over to Gianna and congratulated her . As the applause began to die down , I raised my hand to be recognized one more time . Mr. Speaker , members , if you would allow me just a few more moments I would appreciate your time . My name is Ted Harvey , not Paul Harvey , but , please , let me tell you the rest of the story . The cause of Gianna &apos;s cerebral palsy is not because of some biological freak of nature , but rather the choice of her mother . You see when her biological mother was 17-years - old and 7-and - a-half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to seek a late - term abortion . The abortionist performed a saline abortion on this 17-year - old girl . This procedure requires the injection of a high concentration of saline into the mother &apos;s womb , which the fetus is then bathed in and swallows , which results in the fetus being burned to death , inside and out . Within 24 hours the results are normally an induced , still - born abortion . As Gianna can testify , the procedure is not always 100 percent effective . Gianna is an aborted late - term fetus who was born alive . The high concentration of saline in the womb for 24 hours resulted in a lack of oxygen to her brain and is the cause of her cerebral palsy . Members , today , we are going to recognize the 90th anniversary of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood ... &apos;&apos; BANG ! The gavel came down . Just as I was finishing the last sentence of my speech -- the climax of the morning -- the speaker of the House gaveled me down and said , `` Representative Harvey , I will allow you to continue your introduction , but not for the purposes of debating a measure now pending before the House . &apos;&apos; At which point I said , `` Mr. Speaker , I understand . I just wanted to put a face to what we are celebrating today . &apos;&apos; Silence . Deafening silence . I then walked back to my chair shaking like a leaf . The Democrats would n&apos;t look at me . They were fuming . It was beautiful . I have been in the Legislature for five tough years , and this made it all worthwhile . The House majority leader would n&apos;t talk to me the rest of the day . Was it because I introduced an abortion survivor , or was it because we touched her soul ? She could congratulate an inspirational cerebral palsy victim and advocate , but was outraged when she discovered that the person she congratulated was also an abortion survivor . The headline in The Denver Post the next day read `` Abortion Jab Earns Rebuke . &apos;&apos; The majority leader is quoted as saying , `` I think it was amazingly rude to use a human being as an example of his personal politics . &apos;&apos; Yes , Representative Madden , Gianna Jessen is a human being . She was when she was in her mother &apos;s womb , and she was when she sang the national anthem on the floor of the Colorado House of Representatives . The paper went on to quote Gianna , stating she was glad I told her story . `` We need to discuss the humanity of it . I &apos; m glad to be able to speak up for children in the womb , &apos;&apos; she said . `` If abortion is about women &apos;s rights , where were my rights ? &apos;&apos; All I can say is , `` Glory to God ! &apos;&apos; He orchestrated it all , every minute of it , and I was so honored to have been chosen to play a part . May we all continue to be filled with and to fight for the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ !",,2_Moderately_Formal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,-3_Very_Informal,,3_Very_Formal,,-3_Very_Informal,,1_Slightly_Formal,,,,,,,,,,,

Xenophobia means `` fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign &apos;&apos; Homophobia means &apos;&apos; irrational fear of , aversion to , or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals &apos;&apos; I have seen a couple of research articles which explicitly states that the majority of people who have homophobia fall under the `` aversion to , or discrimination against &apos;&apos; category and not really the `` irrational fear of &apos;&apos; category . If that is the case we have a poor use of language rather than a common misconception . I am averse to sugary cereals , but I do not fear them . Homophobia has a very clear Greek root meaning of fear . The claustrophobe does not discriminate against enclosed spaces , he is afraid of them . Phobic implies fear , it does not imply discrimination . One may act out of fear , but it does not necessarily follow that ones actions must be taken out of fear .

Thank you for the opportunity to clarify . Quote : Your analogy is not parallel enough to really capture the situation . It &apos;s not just `` owning a cat &apos;&apos; , but rather people are making a sweeping decision that cat pictures may not be present in a yearbook . They blacked out a cat picture in a yearbook as inappropriate , ignoring the multiple dog pictures which are nearby . If they did n&apos;t want to buy a yearbook because they did n&apos;t want a picture of a cat , that is one thing . But to deny everybody an opportunity to buy the yearbook with the picture of a cat in it ? That is an entirely different matter . I changed my mind . I hate cats . Dogs too . I am an equal opportunity proponent of quadriped hatred . Ahh . So you liken homosexuality to swearing then , eh ? And heterosexuality ? Would that be closer to reciting the Pledge of Allegiance ? Both behaviors adults take part in . Neither of which are appropriate for 14 year olds . If you believe that I am likening the two , you may use your logic to also liken homosexuality to cigars , fine wine , and real estate if it makes you feel better .

I want to share with you an awesome experience I had in the Colorado House of Representatives on May 8 . It is a humbling experience to look back and realize that God used me to play a role in His divine orchestration . I was leaving the House chambers for the weekend when our Democrat speaker of the House announced that the coming Monday would be the final day of this year &apos;s General Assembly . He went on to state that there were still numerous resolutions on the calendar which we would need to be addressed prior to the summer adjournment . Interestingly , he specifically mentioned that one of the resolutions we would be hearing was being carried by the House Majority Leader Alice Madden , honoring the 90th anniversary of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains . As a strong pro - life legislator I was disgusted by the idea that we would pass a resolution honoring this 90-year legacy of genocide . I drove home that night wondering what I could say that might pierce the darkness during the debate on this heinous resolution . On Saturday morning , I took my 8-year - old son up to the mountains to go white - water rafting . The trip lasted all day . As we were driving home , exhausted and hungry , I remembered that I had accepted an invitation to attend a fundraising dinner that night for a local pro - life organization . One of my most respected mentors had personally called me several weeks earlier and asked me to attend , so I knew I &apos; d have to clean up and head over . After our meal , the executive director of the organization introduced the keynote speaker . I looked up and saw walking to the stage a handicapped young lady being assisted to the microphone by a young man holding a guitar . Her name was Gianna Jessen . Gianna said `` Hello , &apos;&apos; welcomed everyone , and then sang three of the most beautiful Christian songs I have ever heard . She then began to give her testimony . When her biological mother was 17 years old and seven and a half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to have an abortion . As God would have it , the abortion failed and a beautiful 2-pound baby girl was brought into the world . Unfortunately , she was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors thought that she would never survive . The doctors were wrong . Imagine the timing ! A survivor of a Planned Parenthood abortion arrived in town just days before the Colorado House of Representatives was to celebrate Planned Parenthood &apos;s `` wonderful &apos;&apos; work . As I listened to Gianna &apos;s amazing testimony , the Lord inspired me to ask her if she could stay in Denver until Monday morning so that I could introduce her on the floor of the House and tell her story . Perhaps she could even begin the final day &apos;s session by singing our country &apos;s national anthem ! To my surprise she said she would seriously consider it . If she were to agree , she wanted her accompanying guitarist to stay as well . A lady standing in line behind me waiting to meet Gianna overheard our conversation and said that she would be willing to pay for the guitarist &apos;s room . Gianna then said that she would think about it . As I was driving home from the banquet , my cell phone rang . It was Gianna , and she immediately said , `` I &apos; m in , let &apos;s ruin this celebration . &apos;&apos; Praise God ! When Monday morning came , I awoke at 6 a.m. to write my speech before heading to the Capitol . As I wrote down the words , I could sense God &apos;s help and I knew that this was going to be a powerful moment for the pro - life movement . Following a committee hearing , I rushed into the House chambers just as the opening morning prayer was about to be given . Between the prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance , I wrote a quick note to the speaker of the House explaining that Gianna is an advocate for cerebral palsy . I took the note to the speaker and asked if I could have my friend open the last day of session by singing the national anthem . Without any hesitation the speaker took the microphone and said , `` Before we begin , Representative Harvey has made available for us Gianna Jessen to sing the national anthem . &apos;&apos; Gianna sang the most amazing rendition of The Star Spangled Banner that you could possibly imagine . Every person in the entire chamber was completely still , quiet and in awe of this frail young lady &apos;s voice . Due to her cerebral palsy , Gianna often loses her balance , and shortly after starting to sing she grabbed my arm to stabilize herself , and I could tell that she was shaking . Suddenly , midway through the song , she forgot the words and began to hum and then said , `` Please forgive me ; I am so nervous . &apos;&apos; She then immediately began singing again and every House member and every guest throughout the chambers began to sing along with her to give her encouragement and to lift her up . As I looked around the huge hall I listened to the unbelievable melody of Gianna &apos;s voice being accompanied by a choir of over 100 voices . I had chills running all over my body , and I knew that I had just witnessed an act of God . As the song concluded the speaker of the House explained that Gianna has cerebral palsy and is an activist to bring awareness to the disease . `` Let us give her a hand not only for her performance today , but also for her advocacy work , &apos;&apos; he said . The chamber immediately exploded into applause -- she had them all in the palm of her hand . The speaker then called the House to order , and we proceeded as usual to allow members to make any announcements or introductions of guests . For dramatic effect , I waited until I was the last person remaining before I introduced Gianna . As I waited for my turn , I nervously paced back and forth praying to God that he would give me the peace , confidence and the courage necessary to pull off what I knew would be one of the most dramatic and controversial moments of my political career . While I waited , a prominent reporter from one of the major Denver newspapers walked over to Gianna and told her that her rendition captured the spirit of the national anthem more powerfully than any she had ever heard before .

I drove home that night wondering what I could say that might pierce the darkness during the debate on this heinous resolution . On Saturday morning , I took my 8-year - old son up to the mountains to go white - water rafting . The trip lasted all day . As we were driving home , exhausted and hungry , I remembered that I had accepted an invitation to attend a fundraising dinner that night for a local pro - life organization . One of my most respected mentors had personally called me several weeks earlier and asked me to attend , so I knew I &apos; d have to clean up and head over . After our meal , the executive director of the organization introduced the keynote speaker . I looked up and saw walking to the stage a handicapped young lady being assisted to the microphone by a young man holding a guitar . Her name was Gianna Jessen . Gianna said `` Hello , &apos;&apos; welcomed everyone , and then sang three of the most beautiful Christian songs I have ever heard . She then began to give her testimony . When her biological mother was 17 years old and seven and a half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to have an abortion . As God would have it , the abortion failed and a beautiful 2-pound baby girl was brought into the world . Unfortunately , she was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors thought that she would never survive . The doctors were wrong . Imagine the timing ! A survivor of a Planned Parenthood abortion arrived in town just days before the Colorado House of Representatives was to celebrate Planned Parenthood &apos;s `` wonderful &apos;&apos; work . As I listened to Gianna &apos;s amazing testimony , the Lord inspired me to ask her if she could stay in Denver until Monday morning so that I could introduce her on the floor of the House and tell her story . Perhaps she could even begin the final day &apos;s session by singing our country &apos;s national anthem ! To my surprise she said she would seriously consider it . If she were to agree , she wanted her accompanying guitarist to stay as well . A lady standing in line behind me waiting to meet Gianna overheard our conversation and said that she would be willing to pay for the guitarist &apos;s room . Gianna then said that she would think about it . As I was driving home from the banquet , my cell phone rang . It was Gianna , and she immediately said , `` I &apos; m in , let &apos;s ruin this celebration . &apos;&apos; Praise God ! When Monday morning came , I awoke at 6 a.m. to write my speech before heading to the Capitol . As I wrote down the words , I could sense God &apos;s help and I knew that this was going to be a powerful moment for the pro - life movement . Following a committee hearing , I rushed into the House chambers just as the opening morning prayer was about to be given . Between the prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance , I wrote a quick note to the speaker of the House explaining that Gianna is an advocate for cerebral palsy . I took the note to the speaker and asked if I could have my friend open the last day of session by singing the national anthem . Without any hesitation the speaker took the microphone and said , `` Before we begin , Representative Harvey has made available for us Gianna Jessen to sing the national anthem . &apos;&apos; Gianna sang the most amazing rendition of The Star Spangled Banner that you could possibly imagine . Every person in the entire chamber was completely still , quiet and in awe of this frail young lady &apos;s voice . Due to her cerebral palsy , Gianna often loses her balance , and shortly after starting to sing she grabbed my arm to stabilize herself , and I could tell that she was shaking . Suddenly , midway through the song , she forgot the words and began to hum and then said , `` Please forgive me ; I am so nervous . &apos;&apos; She then immediately began singing again and every House member and every guest throughout the chambers began to sing along with her to give her encouragement and to lift her up . As I looked around the huge hall I listened to the unbelievable melody of Gianna &apos;s voice being accompanied by a choir of over 100 voices . I had chills running all over my body , and I knew that I had just witnessed an act of God . As the song concluded the speaker of the House explained that Gianna has cerebral palsy and is an activist to bring awareness to the disease . `` Let us give her a hand not only for her performance today , but also for her advocacy work , &apos;&apos; he said . The chamber immediately exploded into applause -- she had them all in the palm of her hand . The speaker then called the House to order , and we proceeded as usual to allow members to make any announcements or introductions of guests . For dramatic effect , I waited until I was the last person remaining before I introduced Gianna . As I waited for my turn , I nervously paced back and forth praying to God that he would give me the peace , confidence and the courage necessary to pull off what I knew would be one of the most dramatic and controversial moments of my political career . While I waited , a prominent reporter from one of the major Denver newspapers walked over to Gianna and told her that her rendition captured the spirit of the national anthem more powerfully than any she had ever heard before . Finally , I was the last person remaining . So , I proceeded to the microphone and began my speech . Members , I would like to introduce you to a new friend and hero of mine -- her name is Gianna Jessen . She is visiting us today from Nashville , Tennessee , where she is an accomplished recording artist . She has cerebral palsy and was raised in foster homes before being adopted at the age of four She was born prematurely and weighed only 2 pounds at birth . She remained in the hospital for almost three months . A doctor once said she had a great will to live and that she fought for her life . Eventually she was able to leave the hospital and be placed in foster care . Because of her cerebral palsy , her foster mother was told that it was doubtful that she would ever crawl or walk . She could not sit up independently . Through the prayers and dedication of her foster mother , she eventually learned to sit up , crawl , then stand . Shortly before her fourth birthday , she began to walk with leg braces and a walker . She continued in physical therapy and after a total of four surgeries , she was able to walk without assistance . She still falls sometimes , but she says she has learned how to fall gracefully after falling for 29 years . Two years ago , she walked into a local health club and said she wanted a private trainer . At the time her legs could not lift 30 pounds . Today she can leg press 200 pounds . She became so physically fit that she began running marathons to raise money and awareness for cerebral palsy . She just returned last week from England where she ran in the London Marathon . It took her more than eight - and-a-half hours to complete . They were taking down the course by the time she made it to the finish line . But she made it , nonetheless . With bloody feet and aching joints , she finished the race . Members would you help me recognize a modern - day hero -- Gianna Jessen ? At this point the chamber exploded into applause which lasted for 15-to-20 seconds . Gianna had touched their souls . Ironically , Alice Madden , the majority leader and sponsor of the Planned Parenthood resolution , walked over to Gianna and congratulated her . As the applause began to die down , I raised my hand to be recognized one more time . Mr. Speaker , members , if you would allow me just a few more moments I would appreciate your time . My name is Ted Harvey , not Paul Harvey , but , please , let me tell you the rest of the story . The cause of Gianna &apos;s cerebral palsy is not because of some biological freak of nature , but rather the choice of her mother . You see when her biological mother was 17-years - old and 7-and - a-half months pregnant , she went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to seek a late - term abortion . The abortionist performed a saline abortion on this 17-year - old girl . This procedure requires the injection of a high concentration of saline into the mother &apos;s womb , which the fetus is then bathed in and swallows , which results in the fetus being burned to death , inside and out . Within 24 hours the results are normally an induced , still - born abortion . As Gianna can testify , the procedure is not always 100 percent effective . Gianna is an aborted late - term fetus who was born alive . The high concentration of saline in the womb for 24 hours resulted in a lack of oxygen to her brain and is the cause of her cerebral palsy . Members , today , we are going to recognize the 90th anniversary of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood ... &apos;&apos; BANG ! The gavel came down . Just as I was finishing the last sentence of my speech -- the climax of the morning -- the speaker of the House gaveled me down and said , `` Representative Harvey , I will allow you to continue your introduction , but not for the purposes of debating a measure now pending before the House . &apos;&apos; At which point I said , `` Mr. Speaker , I understand . I just wanted to put a face to what we are celebrating today . &apos;&apos; Silence . Deafening silence . I then walked back to my chair shaking like a leaf . The Democrats would n&apos;t look at me . They were fuming . It was beautiful . I have been in the Legislature for five tough years , and this made it all worthwhile . The House majority leader would n&apos;t talk to me the rest of the day . Was it because I introduced an abortion survivor , or was it because we touched her soul ? She could congratulate an inspirational cerebral palsy victim and advocate , but was outraged when she discovered that the person she congratulated was also an abortion survivor . The headline in The Denver Post the next day read `` Abortion Jab Earns Rebuke . &apos;&apos; The majority leader is quoted as saying , `` I think it was amazingly rude to use a human being as an example of his personal politics . &apos;&apos; Yes , Representative Madden , Gianna Jessen is a human being . She was when she was in her mother &apos;s womb , and she was when she sang the national anthem on the floor of the Colorado House of Representatives . The paper went on to quote Gianna , stating she was glad I told her story . `` We need to discuss the humanity of it . I &apos; m glad to be able to speak up for children in the womb , &apos;&apos; she said . `` If abortion is about women &apos;s rights , where were my rights ? &apos;&apos; All I can say is , `` Glory to God ! &apos;&apos; He orchestrated it all , every minute of it , and I was so honored to have been chosen to play a part . May we all continue to be filled with and to fight for the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ !",,3_Very_Formal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,1_Slightly_Formal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,1_Slightly_Formal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,,,,,,,,,,

As hard as this may be to believe , not everybody caters to a homophobic tendency ... Again , I reject the notion that the only response other than homophilia is homophobia . Unless you recognize that there people are capable of approaching an issue with something other than love or hate , there is no room for rational argument . It is a common misconception that &apos;&apos; - phobia &apos;&apos; means just `` fear &apos;&apos; . Xenophobia means `` fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign &apos;&apos; Homophobia means &apos;&apos; irrational fear of , aversion to , or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals &apos;&apos; I have seen a couple of research articles which explicitly states that the majority of people who have homophobia fall under the `` aversion to , or discrimination against &apos;&apos; category and not really the `` irrational fear of &apos;&apos; category . If that is the case we have a poor use of language rather than a common misconception . I am averse to sugary cereals , but I do not fear them . Homophobia has a very clear Greek root meaning of fear . The claustrophobe does not discriminate against enclosed spaces , he is afraid of them . Phobic implies fear , it does not imply discrimination . One may act out of fear , but it does not necessarily follow that ones actions must be taken out of fear . But only the homosexual kiss , and not the heterosexual groping on the EXACT OPPOSITE PAGE . Does n&apos;t that say something to you ? Not wild about the groping either . Thank you for the opportunity to clarify . Quote : Your analogy is not parallel enough to really capture the situation . It &apos;s not just `` owning a cat &apos;&apos; , but rather people are making a sweeping decision that cat pictures may not be present in a yearbook . They blacked out a cat picture in a yearbook as inappropriate , ignoring the multiple dog pictures which are nearby . If they did n&apos;t want to buy a yearbook because they did n&apos;t want a picture of a cat , that is one thing . But to deny everybody an opportunity to buy the yearbook with the picture of a cat in it ? That is an entirely different matter . I changed my mind . I hate cats . Dogs too . I am an equal opportunity proponent of quadriped hatred . Ahh . So you liken homosexuality to swearing then , eh ? And heterosexuality ? Would that be closer to reciting the Pledge of Allegiance ? Both behaviors adults take part in . Neither of which are appropriate for 14 year olds . If you believe that I am likening the two , you may use your logic to also liken homosexuality to cigars , fine wine , and real estate if it makes you feel better . Your claim of `` fact &apos;&apos; is obviously hotly contested . Or to put it another way , are you freakin &apos; kidding me ? These kids can turn on any TV and watch a LOT more intense action than just a casual kiss . These kids can buy a variety of magazines off the rack that include more intense action than just a casual kiss . Are you of the mind that we should also go through their World History books to ensure that there are n&apos;t any pictures of `` art &apos;&apos; which does n&apos;t have an appropriate level of clothing on ? Is that the type of censorship your `` decency &apos;&apos; requires ? Or is it just the gay kiss thing you want to keep in the closet , while heterosexual equivalents are ignored ? You &apos; re treating this gay KISS like it &apos;s pornography . And no sir . That is NOT a `` fact &apos;&apos; . I am also treating this gay kiss like cigars , fine wine and real estate . There are a lot of things that kids can be exposed to outside of school . That exposure has no impact on what they should be exposed to in a gubment school which they are compelled by law to attend .

I want to share with you an awesome experience I had in the Colorado House of Representatives on May 8 . It is a humbling experience to look back and realize that God used me to play a role in His divine orchestration . I was leaving the House chambers for the weekend when our Democrat speaker of the House announced that the coming Monday would be the final day of this year &apos;s General Assembly . He went on to state that there were still numerous resolutions on the calendar which we would need to be addressed prior to the summer adjournment . Interestingly , he specifically mentioned that one of the resolutions we would be hearing was being carried by the House Majority Leader Alice Madden , honoring the 90th anniversary of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains .

Economic liberalization , including reduced controls on foreign trade and investment , began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country &apos;s growth , which has averaged more than 7 % per year since 1997 . India &apos;s diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming , modern agriculture , handicrafts , a wide range of modern industries , and a multitude of services . Slightly more than half of the work force is in agriculture , but services are the major source of economic growth , accounting for more than half of India &apos;s output , with only one - third of its labor force . India has capitalized on its large educated English - speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services and software workers . An industrial slowdown early in 2008 , followed by the global financial crisis , led annual GDP growth to slow to 6.1 % in 2009 , still second highest growth in the world among major economies . India escaped the brunt of the global financial crisis because of cautious banking policies and a relatively low dependence on exports for growth . Domestic demand , driven by purchases of consumer durables and automobiles , has re - emerged as a key driver of growth , as exports have fallen since the global crisis started . India &apos;s fiscal deficit increased substantially in 2008 due to fuel and fertilizer subsidies , a debt waiver program for farmers , a job guarantee program for rural workers , and stimulus expenditures . The government abandoned its deficit target and allowed the deficit to reach 6.8 % of GDP in FY10 . Nevertheless , as shares of GDP , both government spending and taxation are among the lowest in the world . The government has expressed a commitment to fiscal stimulus in FY10 , and to deficit reduction the following two years .

Economic liberalization , including reduced controls on foreign trade and investment , began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country &apos;s growth , which has averaged more than 7 % per year since 1997 . India &apos;s diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming , modern agriculture , handicrafts , a wide range of modern industries , and a multitude of services . Slightly more than half of the work force is in agriculture , but services are the major source of economic growth , accounting for more than half of India &apos;s output , with only one - third of its labor force . India has capitalized on its large educated English - speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services and software workers . An industrial slowdown early in 2008 , followed by the global financial crisis , led annual GDP growth to slow to 6.1 % in 2009 , still second highest growth in the world among major economies . India escaped the brunt of the global financial crisis because of cautious banking policies and a relatively low dependence on exports for growth . Domestic demand , driven by purchases of consumer durables and automobiles , has re - emerged as a key driver of growth , as exports have fallen since the global crisis started . India &apos;s fiscal deficit increased substantially in 2008 due to fuel and fertilizer subsidies , a debt waiver program for farmers , a job guarantee program for rural workers , and stimulus expenditures . The government abandoned its deficit target and allowed the deficit to reach 6.8 % of GDP in FY10 . Nevertheless , as shares of GDP , both government spending and taxation are among the lowest in the world . The government has expressed a commitment to fiscal stimulus in FY10 , and to deficit reduction the following two years . It has increased the pace of privatization of government - owned companies , partly to offset the deficit . India &apos;s long term challenges include widespread poverty , inadequate physical and social infrastructure , limited employment opportunities , and insufficient access to basic and higher education . Over the long - term , a growing population and changing demographics will only exacerbate social , economic , and environmental problems . https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the - world-factbook/geos/in.html I repeat : What is your country doing about the overpopulation , environmental and over - consumerism problems ? emoticon_emb",,183404,"OK Bill : I think this would make an instructive ( and topical ) subject for a formal debate .

Most progressive people who have `` actually peeked behind the curtain &apos;&apos; have come to learn that gays are just like anybody else for the most part and are , for the most part , totally harmless to society . These progressive people have no problem , whatsoever , in letting the gays take their rightful place in society with all due rights and privileges afforded to any other , tax paying , law abiding , adult citizen . In my opinion , regarding the regressives , it &apos;s simply a matter of lack of understanding and education and the reluctance to be taught . It &apos;s a matter of sticking one &apos;s fingers in one &apos;s ears and screaming `` LALALALALALALALALA &apos;&apos; I DO N&apos;T HEAR YOU ! ! LALALALALALA &apos;&apos; As society is evolving and becoming more educated and tolerant towards those of an alternate lifestyle , the people opposed to this acceptance are slowly but surely dwindling away . ( Twenty years ago , `` XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy &apos;&apos; would have never been accepted . ) The Regressives who adamantly fear this change in society are going to great lengths to anchor their belief and moral system into a constitutional vault to disable our society from evolving further or even considering the issue . Even if their actions are nothing less than facist . I think their take on it is `` Desperate times require desperate measures and if that means facism , then so be it . &apos;&apos; The only thing is , the gay issues before us all as a society do NOT equate to `` desperate times . &apos;&apos; We have people blowing themselves up , starving , hurricanes and yet some folks focus on gays marrying ? What does that say about them ? The only people who have problems with gays are the people who LET themselves have problems with gays . Myself , I &apos; m a breeder . I emoticon_love my women . Well , I &apos; d best say I love my wife emoticon_xlove ( she might be reading this :p ) But loving her is MY choice . I will NOT let any government , person , facist , liberal , extremist , tell me who I can or can not love . I imagine the gays feel very much the same . And they should . It is arrogant for the Regressives to try to lay claim to love and all the civil laws regarding it . Nobody owns marriage . To deny a couple of any sex that are of legal age and consenting minds any benefits ( or penalties ) marriage would entitle them is not only regressive but un - American . If the regressives had their way they would make law , `` We are free enough . Liberty stops here . 2005 . No more liberties allowed . Deal with it &apos;&apos; Further , their hiding behind `` Love the sinner hate the sin &apos;&apos; excuse does n&apos;t fool anyone . The `` Marriage Protectors &apos;&apos; do n&apos;t fool us either . These people are homophobic . Pure and simple . The rhetoric and spin does n&apos;t fool anyone .

For an example of this type of manipulation of law , if , in the murder of a pregnant woman , a law is introduced in which the killing of her fetus is also considered a murder ( making it a double murder ) , that opens judicial paths to counting the fetus ( at any stage ) as having the same rights against being killed as any other person .

Using the word `` faith &apos;&apos; is an admission that what you believe will not stand up to logic and reason . What else do we have besides reason , simple `` faith &apos;&apos; ? Submitting and obeying on `` faith &apos;&apos; , is not very thoughtful . Morality in its highest form , requires a great deal of thought and understanding , does it not ? Therefore , atheists can most certainly be very moral , as can thoughtful religious people . Some quotes from Ayn Rand ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Ask youself whether the dream of heaven and greatness should be waiting for us in our graves -- or whether it should be ours here and now and on this earth . In that world , you &apos; ll be able to rise in the morning with the spirit you had known in your childhood : that spirit of eagerness , adventure and certainty which comes from dealing with a rational universe . The good , say the mystics of spirit , is God , a being whose only definition is that he is beyond man &apos;s power to conceive - a definition that invalidates man &apos;s consciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence ... Man &apos;s mind , say the mystics of spirit , must be subordinated to the will of God ... Man &apos;s standard of value , say the mystics of spirit , is the pleasure of God , whose standards are beyond man &apos;s power of comprehension and must be accepted on faith ... The purpose of man &apos;s life ... is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he does not know , for reasons he is not to question . [ Ayn Rand , For the New Intellectual ] For centuries , the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protection racket - by making life on earth unbearable , then charging you for consolation and relief , by forbidding all the virtues that make existence possible , then riding on the shoulders of your guilt , by declaring production and joy to be sins , then collecting blackmail from the sinners . [ Ayn Rand , For the New Intellectual ] ... if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality , then there is no greater , nobler , more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking ... the alleged short - cut to knowledge , which is faith , is only a short - circuit destroying the mind . [ Ayn Rand , Atlas Shrugged ] Playboy : Has no religion , in your estimation , ever offered anything of constructive value to human life ? Ayn Rand : Qua religion , no - in the sense of blind belief , belief unsupported by , or contrary to , the facts of reality and the conclusions of reason . Faith , as such , is extremely detrimental to human life : it is the negation of reason . But you must remember that religion is an early form of philosophy , that the first attempts to explain the universe , to give a coherent frame of reference to man &apos;s life and a code of moral values , were made by religion , before men graduated or developed enough to have philosophy . And , as philosophies , some religions have very valuable moral points . They may have a good influence or proper principles to inculcate , but in a very contradictory context and , on a very - how should I say it ? - dangerous or malevolent base : on the ground of faith . [ Playboy interview with Ayn Rand ] If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine does n&apos;t make sense - you &apos; re ready for him . You tell him there &apos;s something above sense . That here he must not try to think , he must feel . He must believe . Suspend reason and you can play it deuces wild . [ Ayn Rand , The Fountainhead ] And now I see the face of god , and I raise this god over the earth , this god whom men have sought since men came into being , this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride . This god , this one word : I. [ Ayn Rand , Anthem ] If I were to speak your kind of language , I would say that man &apos;s only moral commandment is : Thou shalt think . But a ` moral commandment &apos; is a contradiction in terms . The moral is the chosen , not the forced ; the understood , not the obeyed . The moral is the rational , and reason accepts no commandments . There has never been a philosophy , a theory or a doctrine , that attacked ( or ` limited &apos; ) reason , which did not preach submission to the power of some authority . [ Ayn Rand , The Comprachicos , in The New Left ] Are you in a universe which is ruled by natural laws and , therefore , is stable , firm , absolute - and knowable ? Or are you in an incomprehensible chaos , a realm of inexplicable miracles , an unpredictable , unknowable flux , which your mind is impotent to grasp ? The nature of your actions - and of your ambition - will be different , according to which set of answers you come to accept . ( The Doctrine of Original Sin ) declares that ( man ) ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge - he acquired a mind and became a rational being . It was the knowledge of good and evil - he became a moral being / He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor - he became a productive being . He was sentenced to experience desire - he acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment . The evils for which ( the preachers ) damn him are reason , morality , creativeness joy - all the cardinal values of his existence . The alleged short - cut to knowledge , which is faith , is only a short circuit destroying the mind . Faith is the wors curse of mankind , as the exact antithesis and enemy of thought . [ T ] he only real moral crime that one man can commit against another is the attempt to create , by his words or actions , an impression of the contradictory , the impossible , the irrational , and thus shake the concept of rationality in his victim . Definitions are the guardians of rationality , the first line of defense against the chaos of mental disintegration . To fear to face an issue is to believe the worst is true . Thinking men can not be ruled . To rest one &apos;s case on faith means to concede that reason is on the side of one &apos;s enemies - that one has no rational arguments to offer . ... if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality , then there is no greater , nobler , more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking ... the alleged short - cut to knowledge , which is faith , is only a short - circuit destroying the mind . [ Ayn Rand , Atlas Shrugged ] `` Do not lose your knowledge that man &apos;s proper estate is an upright posture , an intransigent mind , and a step that travels unlimited roads . &apos;&apos; [ John Galt , in Ayn Rand &apos;s Atlas Shrugged ]",,120909,"The question is , which one is the greater risk ?",,157126,"This is something that I know something about so I wanted to give my input on this . 1 .

I &apos; m not doubting that some people have called them a different species . I said that their classification is controversial and has gone both ways , from the same species arguable to different species ( but should probably go back to being the same species ) . The article that you cite takes pains to make the same point , contrary to what you imply by selective quoting . The rest of the article says things like : Whether neandertals are a ` breed apart &apos; or not is of great interest , but the ToE is perfectly comfortable whichever way the facts turn out . Your claim is beyond stupid - if , as you say , `` science needs the Neanderthals be a different species &apos;&apos; , how come so many evolutionary biologists held to the opposite conclusion for so long ? This is not an area where the ToE predicts or needs a specific outcome . Biologists have never disputed that phenotype reflects more than just genotype alone ( if you &apos; ve had nose surgery , you &apos; ve altered your phenotype ) , although note that the changes you mention are neither genetic nor heritable , so they are not evolutionary . You continue to state , without evidence , that there is insufficient time for the changes to happen . A weight increase of 0.1 % per generation could take a mouse - size creature to an elephant - size creature in 60,000 years . Compared to that , biologists have measured size changes of various body parts as high as 5-10 % in a single generation ( e.g. , Grant with Geospiza ) . There are a lot of reasons why such a change is unlikely to happen so quickly over the long term , but it is sufficent to question your claim of insufficient time . Also , a small change in a regulatory gene can immediately have many diverse effects : look up what can happen during environmentally - induced neoteny , for instance , as an example of what could happen during neoteny induced by genetic mutations .",,266183,"Or maybe you do n&apos;t want to reveal that you &apos; ve got nothing for an argument other than `` Godsaidit ! &apos;&apos; and that is why you wo n&apos;t give any of these amazing examples . : xbanghead Oh , and the `` lifestyle &apos;&apos; of homosexuals is no more `` disease ridden , plague infested &apos;&apos; and `` social negative &apos;&apos; than your own heterosexual `` lifestyle &apos;&apos; .

Further research shows that the estrogen in soy does have some potentially disturbing side affects . The bolded sections speak directly to some very real possible side effects that if one reads WAY into them , he might be able to worry about the higher estrogen levels affecting developing boys sexuality . I &apos; m not saying I think this , but it has n&apos;t been proven that it could n&apos;t happen according to this article . http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/food/soy_story.html Soy and Reproduction : Breeding Discontent Scientists have known since the mid-1940s that phytoestrogens can impair fertility . Fertility problems in cows , sheep , rabbits , cheetahs , guinea pigs , birds , and mice have all been reported .63 , 64 Although scientists discovered only recently that soy lowers testosterone levels , 65 tofu has traditionally been used in Buddhist monasteries to decrease the libido , and by Japanese women to punish straying husbands . Humans and animals appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of soy estrogens prenatally , during infancy and puberty , during pregnancy and lactation , and during the hormonal shifts of menopause . Of all these groups , infants on soy formula are at the highest risk because of their small size and developmental phase , and because formula is their main source of nutrient .66 , 67 A crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth - the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non - breastfed babies . Normally during this period , the body surges with natural estrogens , testosterones , and other hormones that are meant to program the baby &apos;s reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood . For infants on soy formula , this programming may be interrupted.68-70 Male infants experience a testosterone surge during the first few months of life and produce androgens in amounts equal to those of adult men . So much testosterone at such a tender age is needed to program the body for puberty , the time when a male &apos;s sex organs should develop and he should begin to express male characteristics such as facial and pubic hair and a deep voice . If receptor sites intended for the hormone testosterone are occupied by soy estrogens , however , appropriate development may never take place.71-74 To date , most of the evidence damning soy formula can be found only in animal studies , because investigations in which humans &apos; sex hormone levels are lowered experimentally can not ethically be done . However , in the years since soy formula has been in the marketplace , parents and pediatricians have reported growing numbers of boys whose physical maturation is either delayed or does not occur at all . Breasts , underdeveloped gonads , undescended testicles ( cryptorchidism ) , and steroid insufficiencies are increasingly common . Sperm counts are also falling.75-79 Soy formula is bad news for girls as well . Natural estrogen levels approximately double during the first month of life , then decline and remain at low levels until puberty . With increased estrogens in the environment in the diet , an alarming number of girls are entering puberty much earlier than normal.80-82 One percent of girls now show signs of puberty , such as breast development or pubic hair , before the age of three . By the age of eight , 14.7 percent of Caucasian girls and 48.3 percent of African American girls had one or both of these characteristics .83 The fact that blacks experience earlier puberties than whites is not a racial difference but a recent phenomenon .84 , 85 Most experts blame this epidemic of `` precocious puberty &apos;&apos; on environmental estrogens from plastics , pesticides , commercial meats , etc . , but some pediatric endocrinologists believe that soy is a contributor .86 Of all the estrogens found in the environment , soy is the likeliest explanation of why African American girls reach puberty so quickly . Since its establishment in 1974 , the federal government &apos;s Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) program has provided free infant formula to teenage and other low - income mothers while failing to encourage breastfeeding . Because of perceived or real lactose intolerance , black babies are much more likely to receive soy formula than Caucasian babies . Early maturation in girls heralds reproductive problems later in life , including amenorrhea ( failure to menstruate ) , anovulatory cycles ( cycles in which no egg is released ) , impaired follicular development ( follicles failing to mature and develop into healthy eggs ) , erratic hormonal surges , and other problems associated with infertility . Because the mammary glands depend on estrogen for their development and functioning , the presence of soy estrogens at a susceptible time might predispose girls to breast cancer , another condition that is on the rise and definitively linked to early puberty .87 Recently , a team of researchers headed by Brian L. Strom , MD , studied the use of soy formula and its long - term impact on reproductive health . They announced only one adverse finding : longer , more painful menstrual periods among women who &apos; d been fed soy formula in infancy .88 Dr. Strom &apos;s conclusion that the results were `` reassuring &apos;&apos; made newspaper headlines all over the world , though the data in the body of the report were anything but . Indeed , data left out of the headlines and buried in the report revealed higher incidences of allergies and asthma , and higher rates of cervical cancer , polycystic ovarian syndrome , blocked fallopian tubes , and pelvic inflammatory disease .89 Although thyroid damage from soy formula has been the principal concern of critics for decades , the researchers excluded thyroid function as a subject for study . Not surprisingly , this study was funded in part by the infant - formula industry . Most of the fears concerning soy formula have focused on estrogens . There are other problems as well , notably much higher levels of aluminum , fluoride , and manganese than are found in either breastmilk or dairy formulas.90-96 All three metals have the potential to adversely affect brain development . Although trace amounts of manganese are vital to the development of the brain , toxic levels accrued from ingestion of soy formula during infancy have been found in children suffering from attention - deficit disorders , dyslexia , and other learning problems .97 , 98 Soy apologists sometimes argue that the plant hormones in soy formula could not possibly be harmful because Japanese women eat a lot of soy products and so must have high levels of phytoestrogens in their breastmilk . Researchers , however , have measured the soy isoflavones in breastmilk and found them low even in vegetarian women who consume copious quantities of tofu , soy milk , soy protein shakes , and other soy foods.99-101 Limited evidence , however , suggests that vegetarian women who eat a lot of soy foods during pregnancy may put their infants at risk in terms of their future reproductive health , fertility , and possibly increased risk of breast cancer . All of the problems that have befallen infants on soy formula , as well as estrogen - related birth defects , have occurred ( in animal studies , at least ) to the offspring of mothers who were given high doses of soy during pregnancy .102 One of these birth defects that has been linked to vegetarian diets in humans is hypospadias , a developmental disorder in which the opening of the penis is located on the underside of the shaft .103 Until soy estrogens are definitely linked to reproductive - tract abnormalities , infertility , and other health problems in humans , most health authorities recommend that we `` wait and see . &apos;&apos; This could be a terrible mistake . In the 1940s and 1950s , another estrogen , diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , was widely given to Western women early in their pregnancies in a misguided attempt to prevent miscarriage . That fact is relevant not only because DES bears a striking structural similarity to some plant estrogens - including soy isoflavones - but because it took more than 20 years before the full spectrum of harmful effects was observed .104 , 105 DES is 100,000 times more potent than soy phytoestrogens . However , the large quantities of phytoestrogens in soy products are more than enough to counteract their lower potency . When the effects of isoflavones in fetal and neonatal animals have been studied , they have paralleled those observed in human infants exposed to DES .106 , 107 Recent studies indicate that the soy isoflavone known as genistein may be even more carcinogenic than DES .108 Yet the belief persists that soy hormones are `` safe &apos;&apos; because they are `` weak &apos;&apos; and `` natural . &apos;&apos; Although the soy industry has claimed that soy estrogens are anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 times weaker than the human estrogen estradiol , the correct figure is only 1,200 times as weak .109 Though this still sounds quite weak , it is not - because of the quantity of these estrogens ingested by infants on soy formula , and by children and adults who eat soy every day . These individuals consume far more soy estrogens than were ever part of a traditional diet in Asia . The average isoflavones intake in China is 3 milligrams , or 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight . In Japan , the figures range from 10 to 28 mg , or 0.17 to 0.47 isoflavones per kg of body weight . In contrast , infants receiving soy formula average 38 mg of isoflavones , which comes to a shocking 6.25 mg/kg of body weight . Compare that dose to the 0.47 mg/kg per day fed to healthy Japanese adult men and women who experienced thyroid suppression after just three months - or to the 0.75 mg/kg of isoflavones fed to American women who experienced hormonal changes sufficient to skew their menstrual cycles after just one month .110 Although children and teenagers are less vulnerable than infants , their young bodies are still developing , and highly vulnerable to endocrine - system disruption by soy . And soy has been shown to pass through the placentas of pregnant women to their unborn babies . Meanwhile , the jury is still out on whether soy might help alleviate menopausal symptoms or prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer . The soy industry &apos;s top scientists , convened at the Fifth International Symposium on the Role of Soy in the Preventing and Reversing Chronic Disease ( held in Orlando , Florida , September 21-24 , 2003 ) , conceded that the data are confusing and contradictory , with some studies suggesting that soy might be helpful , and others showing that soy contributes to osteoporosis and promotes breast cancer . What &apos;s certain is that the levels of soy estrogens that might possibly have a beneficial effect on hormonally related diseases have been proven to jeopardize the health of the thyroid . Likewise , the 25 grams of soy protein per day touted by the FDA to lower cholesterol ( see sidebar , `` Boon to the Industry : The FDA &apos;s Soy Protein Health Claim &apos;&apos; ) is very likely to harm the thyroid , and thus increase one of the risk factors for heart disease . The bottom line is that the safety of soy foods has yet to be proven , and that human beings have become guinea pigs in what Daniel M.

Fertility problems in cows , sheep , rabbits , cheetahs , guinea pigs , birds , and mice have all been reported .63 , 64 Although scientists discovered only recently that soy lowers testosterone levels , 65 tofu has traditionally been used in Buddhist monasteries to decrease the libido , and by Japanese women to punish straying husbands . Humans and animals appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of soy estrogens prenatally , during infancy and puberty , during pregnancy and lactation , and during the hormonal shifts of menopause . Of all these groups , infants on soy formula are at the highest risk because of their small size and developmental phase , and because formula is their main source of nutrient .66 , 67 A crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth - the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non - breastfed babies . Normally during this period , the body surges with natural estrogens , testosterones , and other hormones that are meant to program the baby &apos;s reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood . For infants on soy formula , this programming may be interrupted.68-70 Male infants experience a testosterone surge during the first few months of life and produce androgens in amounts equal to those of adult men . So much testosterone at such a tender age is needed to program the body for puberty , the time when a male &apos;s sex organs should develop and he should begin to express male characteristics such as facial and pubic hair and a deep voice . If receptor sites intended for the hormone testosterone are occupied by soy estrogens , however , appropriate development may never take place.71-74 To date , most of the evidence damning soy formula can be found only in animal studies , because investigations in which humans &apos; sex hormone levels are lowered experimentally can not ethically be done . However , in the years since soy formula has been in the marketplace , parents and pediatricians have reported growing numbers of boys whose physical maturation is either delayed or does not occur at all .

They announced only one adverse finding : longer , more painful menstrual periods among women who &apos; d been fed soy formula in infancy .88 Dr. Strom &apos;s conclusion that the results were `` reassuring &apos;&apos; made newspaper headlines all over the world , though the data in the body of the report were anything but . Indeed , data left out of the headlines and buried in the report revealed higher incidences of allergies and asthma , and higher rates of cervical cancer , polycystic ovarian syndrome , blocked fallopian tubes , and pelvic inflammatory disease .89 Although thyroid damage from soy formula has been the principal concern of critics for decades , the researchers excluded thyroid function as a subject for study . Not surprisingly , this study was funded in part by the infant - formula industry . Most of the fears concerning soy formula have focused on estrogens . There are other problems as well , notably much higher levels of aluminum , fluoride , and manganese than are found in either breastmilk or dairy formulas.90-96 All three metals have the potential to adversely affect brain development . Although trace amounts of manganese are vital to the development of the brain , toxic levels accrued from ingestion of soy formula during infancy have been found in children suffering from attention - deficit disorders , dyslexia , and other learning problems .97 , 98 Soy apologists sometimes argue that the plant hormones in soy formula could not possibly be harmful because Japanese women eat a lot of soy products and so must have high levels of phytoestrogens in their breastmilk . Researchers , however , have measured the soy isoflavones in breastmilk and found them low even in vegetarian women who consume copious quantities of tofu , soy milk , soy protein shakes , and other soy foods.99-101 Limited evidence , however , suggests that vegetarian women who eat a lot of soy foods during pregnancy may put their infants at risk in terms of their future reproductive health , fertility , and possibly increased risk of breast cancer . All of the problems that have befallen infants on soy formula , as well as estrogen - related birth defects , have occurred ( in animal studies , at least ) to the offspring of mothers who were given high doses of soy during pregnancy .102 One of these birth defects that has been linked to vegetarian diets in humans is hypospadias , a developmental disorder in which the opening of the penis is located on the underside of the shaft .103 Until soy estrogens are definitely linked to reproductive - tract abnormalities , infertility , and other health problems in humans , most health authorities recommend that we `` wait and see . &apos;&apos; This could be a terrible mistake . In the 1940s and 1950s , another estrogen , diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , was widely given to Western women early in their pregnancies in a misguided attempt to prevent miscarriage . That fact is relevant not only because DES bears a striking structural similarity to some plant estrogens - including soy isoflavones - but because it took more than 20 years before the full spectrum of harmful effects was observed .104 , 105 DES is 100,000 times more potent than soy phytoestrogens . However , the large quantities of phytoestrogens in soy products are more than enough to counteract their lower potency . When the effects of isoflavones in fetal and neonatal animals have been studied , they have paralleled those observed in human infants exposed to DES .106 , 107 Recent studies indicate that the soy isoflavone known as genistein may be even more carcinogenic than DES .108 Yet the belief persists that soy hormones are `` safe &apos;&apos; because they are `` weak &apos;&apos; and `` natural . &apos;&apos; Although the soy industry has claimed that soy estrogens are anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 times weaker than the human estrogen estradiol , the correct figure is only 1,200 times as weak .109 Though this still sounds quite weak , it is not - because of the quantity of these estrogens ingested by infants on soy formula , and by children and adults who eat soy every day . These individuals consume far more soy estrogens than were ever part of a traditional diet in Asia . The average isoflavones intake in China is 3 milligrams , or 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight . In Japan , the figures range from 10 to 28 mg , or 0.17 to 0.47 isoflavones per kg of body weight . In contrast , infants receiving soy formula average 38 mg of isoflavones , which comes to a shocking 6.25 mg/kg of body weight . Compare that dose to the 0.47 mg/kg per day fed to healthy Japanese adult men and women who experienced thyroid suppression after just three months - or to the 0.75 mg/kg of isoflavones fed to American women who experienced hormonal changes sufficient to skew their menstrual cycles after just one month .110 Although children and teenagers are less vulnerable than infants , their young bodies are still developing , and highly vulnerable to endocrine - system disruption by soy . And soy has been shown to pass through the placentas of pregnant women to their unborn babies . Meanwhile , the jury is still out on whether soy might help alleviate menopausal symptoms or prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer . The soy industry &apos;s top scientists , convened at the Fifth International Symposium on the Role of Soy in the Preventing and Reversing Chronic Disease ( held in Orlando , Florida , September 21-24 , 2003 ) , conceded that the data are confusing and contradictory , with some studies suggesting that soy might be helpful , and others showing that soy contributes to osteoporosis and promotes breast cancer . What &apos;s certain is that the levels of soy estrogens that might possibly have a beneficial effect on hormonally related diseases have been proven to jeopardize the health of the thyroid . Likewise , the 25 grams of soy protein per day touted by the FDA to lower cholesterol ( see sidebar , `` Boon to the Industry : The FDA &apos;s Soy Protein Health Claim &apos;&apos; ) is very likely to harm the thyroid , and thus increase one of the risk factors for heart disease . The bottom line is that the safety of soy foods has yet to be proven , and that human beings have become guinea pigs in what Daniel M.

Fertility problems in cows , sheep , rabbits , cheetahs , guinea pigs , birds , and mice have all been reported .63 , 64 Although scientists discovered only recently that soy lowers testosterone levels , 65 tofu has traditionally been used in Buddhist monasteries to decrease the libido , and by Japanese women to punish straying husbands . Humans and animals appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of soy estrogens prenatally , during infancy and puberty , during pregnancy and lactation , and during the hormonal shifts of menopause . Of all these groups , infants on soy formula are at the highest risk because of their small size and developmental phase , and because formula is their main source of nutrient .66 , 67 A crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth - the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non - breastfed babies . Normally during this period , the body surges with natural estrogens , testosterones , and other hormones that are meant to program the baby &apos;s reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood . For infants on soy formula , this programming may be interrupted.68-70 Male infants experience a testosterone surge during the first few months of life and produce androgens in amounts equal to those of adult men . So much testosterone at such a tender age is needed to program the body for puberty , the time when a male &apos;s sex organs should develop and he should begin to express male characteristics such as facial and pubic hair and a deep voice . If receptor sites intended for the hormone testosterone are occupied by soy estrogens , however , appropriate development may never take place.71-74 To date , most of the evidence damning soy formula can be found only in animal studies , because investigations in which humans &apos; sex hormone levels are lowered experimentally can not ethically be done . However , in the years since soy formula has been in the marketplace , parents and pediatricians have reported growing numbers of boys whose physical maturation is either delayed or does not occur at all . Breasts , underdeveloped gonads , undescended testicles ( cryptorchidism ) , and steroid insufficiencies are increasingly common . Sperm counts are also falling.75-79 Soy formula is bad news for girls as well . Natural estrogen levels approximately double during the first month of life , then decline and remain at low levels until puberty . With increased estrogens in the environment in the diet , an alarming number of girls are entering puberty much earlier than normal.80-82 One percent of girls now show signs of puberty , such as breast development or pubic hair , before the age of three . By the age of eight , 14.7 percent of Caucasian girls and 48.3 percent of African American girls had one or both of these characteristics .83 The fact that blacks experience earlier puberties than whites is not a racial difference but a recent phenomenon .84 , 85 Most experts blame this epidemic of `` precocious puberty &apos;&apos; on environmental estrogens from plastics , pesticides , commercial meats , etc . , but some pediatric endocrinologists believe that soy is a contributor .86 Of all the estrogens found in the environment , soy is the likeliest explanation of why African American girls reach puberty so quickly . Since its establishment in 1974 , the federal government &apos;s Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) program has provided free infant formula to teenage and other low - income mothers while failing to encourage breastfeeding . Because of perceived or real lactose intolerance , black babies are much more likely to receive soy formula than Caucasian babies . Early maturation in girls heralds reproductive problems later in life , including amenorrhea ( failure to menstruate ) , anovulatory cycles ( cycles in which no egg is released ) , impaired follicular development ( follicles failing to mature and develop into healthy eggs ) , erratic hormonal surges , and other problems associated with infertility .

Researchers , however , have measured the soy isoflavones in breastmilk and found them low even in vegetarian women who consume copious quantities of tofu , soy milk , soy protein shakes , and other soy foods.99-101 Limited evidence , however , suggests that vegetarian women who eat a lot of soy foods during pregnancy may put their infants at risk in terms of their future reproductive health , fertility , and possibly increased risk of breast cancer . All of the problems that have befallen infants on soy formula , as well as estrogen - related birth defects , have occurred ( in animal studies , at least ) to the offspring of mothers who were given high doses of soy during pregnancy .102 One of these birth defects that has been linked to vegetarian diets in humans is hypospadias , a developmental disorder in which the opening of the penis is located on the underside of the shaft .103 Until soy estrogens are definitely linked to reproductive - tract abnormalities , infertility , and other health problems in humans , most health authorities recommend that we `` wait and see . &apos;&apos; This could be a terrible mistake . In the 1940s and 1950s , another estrogen , diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , was widely given to Western women early in their pregnancies in a misguided attempt to prevent miscarriage . That fact is relevant not only because DES bears a striking structural similarity to some plant estrogens - including soy isoflavones - but because it took more than 20 years before the full spectrum of harmful effects was observed .104 , 105 DES is 100,000 times more potent than soy phytoestrogens . However , the large quantities of phytoestrogens in soy products are more than enough to counteract their lower potency . When the effects of isoflavones in fetal and neonatal animals have been studied , they have paralleled those observed in human infants exposed to DES .106 , 107 Recent studies indicate that the soy isoflavone known as genistein may be even more carcinogenic than DES .108 Yet the belief persists that soy hormones are `` safe &apos;&apos; because they are `` weak &apos;&apos; and `` natural . &apos;&apos; Although the soy industry has claimed that soy estrogens are anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 times weaker than the human estrogen estradiol , the correct figure is only 1,200 times as weak .109 Though this still sounds quite weak , it is not - because of the quantity of these estrogens ingested by infants on soy formula , and by children and adults who eat soy every day . These individuals consume far more soy estrogens than were ever part of a traditional diet in Asia . The average isoflavones intake in China is 3 milligrams , or 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight . In Japan , the figures range from 10 to 28 mg , or 0.17 to 0.47 isoflavones per kg of body weight . In contrast , infants receiving soy formula average 38 mg of isoflavones , which comes to a shocking 6.25 mg/kg of body weight . Compare that dose to the 0.47 mg/kg per day fed to healthy Japanese adult men and women who experienced thyroid suppression after just three months - or to the 0.75 mg/kg of isoflavones fed to American women who experienced hormonal changes sufficient to skew their menstrual cycles after just one month .110 Although children and teenagers are less vulnerable than infants , their young bodies are still developing , and highly vulnerable to endocrine - system disruption by soy . And soy has been shown to pass through the placentas of pregnant women to their unborn babies . Meanwhile , the jury is still out on whether soy might help alleviate menopausal symptoms or prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer . The soy industry &apos;s top scientists , convened at the Fifth International Symposium on the Role of Soy in the Preventing and Reversing Chronic Disease ( held in Orlando , Florida , September 21-24 , 2003 ) , conceded that the data are confusing and contradictory , with some studies suggesting that soy might be helpful , and others showing that soy contributes to osteoporosis and promotes breast cancer . What &apos;s certain is that the levels of soy estrogens that might possibly have a beneficial effect on hormonally related diseases have been proven to jeopardize the health of the thyroid . Likewise , the 25 grams of soy protein per day touted by the FDA to lower cholesterol ( see sidebar , `` Boon to the Industry : The FDA &apos;s Soy Protein Health Claim &apos;&apos; ) is very likely to harm the thyroid , and thus increase one of the risk factors for heart disease . The bottom line is that the safety of soy foods has yet to be proven , and that human beings have become guinea pigs in what Daniel M.

Further research shows that the estrogen in soy does have some potentially disturbing side affects . The bolded sections speak directly to some very real possible side effects that if one reads WAY into them , he might be able to worry about the higher estrogen levels affecting developing boys sexuality . I &apos; m not saying I think this , but it has n&apos;t been proven that it could n&apos;t happen according to this article . http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/food/soy_story.html Soy and Reproduction : Breeding Discontent Scientists have known since the mid-1940s that phytoestrogens can impair fertility . Fertility problems in cows , sheep , rabbits , cheetahs , guinea pigs , birds , and mice have all been reported .63 , 64 Although scientists discovered only recently that soy lowers testosterone levels , 65 tofu has traditionally been used in Buddhist monasteries to decrease the libido , and by Japanese women to punish straying husbands . Humans and animals appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of soy estrogens prenatally , during infancy and puberty , during pregnancy and lactation , and during the hormonal shifts of menopause . Of all these groups , infants on soy formula are at the highest risk because of their small size and developmental phase , and because formula is their main source of nutrient .66 , 67 A crucial time for the programming of the human reproduction system is right after birth - the very time when bottles of soy formula are given to many non - breastfed babies . Normally during this period , the body surges with natural estrogens , testosterones , and other hormones that are meant to program the baby &apos;s reproductive development from infancy through puberty and into adulthood . For infants on soy formula , this programming may be interrupted.68-70 Male infants experience a testosterone surge during the first few months of life and produce androgens in amounts equal to those of adult men . So much testosterone at such a tender age is needed to program the body for puberty , the time when a male &apos;s sex organs should develop and he should begin to express male characteristics such as facial and pubic hair and a deep voice . If receptor sites intended for the hormone testosterone are occupied by soy estrogens , however , appropriate development may never take place.71-74 To date , most of the evidence damning soy formula can be found only in animal studies , because investigations in which humans &apos; sex hormone levels are lowered experimentally can not ethically be done . However , in the years since soy formula has been in the marketplace , parents and pediatricians have reported growing numbers of boys whose physical maturation is either delayed or does not occur at all . Breasts , underdeveloped gonads , undescended testicles ( cryptorchidism ) , and steroid insufficiencies are increasingly common . Sperm counts are also falling.75-79 Soy formula is bad news for girls as well . Natural estrogen levels approximately double during the first month of life , then decline and remain at low levels until puberty . With increased estrogens in the environment in the diet , an alarming number of girls are entering puberty much earlier than normal.80-82 One percent of girls now show signs of puberty , such as breast development or pubic hair , before the age of three . By the age of eight , 14.7 percent of Caucasian girls and 48.3 percent of African American girls had one or both of these characteristics .83 The fact that blacks experience earlier puberties than whites is not a racial difference but a recent phenomenon .84 , 85 Most experts blame this epidemic of `` precocious puberty &apos;&apos; on environmental estrogens from plastics , pesticides , commercial meats , etc . , but some pediatric endocrinologists believe that soy is a contributor .86 Of all the estrogens found in the environment , soy is the likeliest explanation of why African American girls reach puberty so quickly . Since its establishment in 1974 , the federal government &apos;s Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) program has provided free infant formula to teenage and other low - income mothers while failing to encourage breastfeeding . Because of perceived or real lactose intolerance , black babies are much more likely to receive soy formula than Caucasian babies . Early maturation in girls heralds reproductive problems later in life , including amenorrhea ( failure to menstruate ) , anovulatory cycles ( cycles in which no egg is released ) , impaired follicular development ( follicles failing to mature and develop into healthy eggs ) , erratic hormonal surges , and other problems associated with infertility . Because the mammary glands depend on estrogen for their development and functioning , the presence of soy estrogens at a susceptible time might predispose girls to breast cancer , another condition that is on the rise and definitively linked to early puberty .87 Recently , a team of researchers headed by Brian L. Strom , MD , studied the use of soy formula and its long - term impact on reproductive health . They announced only one adverse finding : longer , more painful menstrual periods among women who &apos; d been fed soy formula in infancy .88 Dr. Strom &apos;s conclusion that the results were `` reassuring &apos;&apos; made newspaper headlines all over the world , though the data in the body of the report were anything but . Indeed , data left out of the headlines and buried in the report revealed higher incidences of allergies and asthma , and higher rates of cervical cancer , polycystic ovarian syndrome , blocked fallopian tubes , and pelvic inflammatory disease .89 Although thyroid damage from soy formula has been the principal concern of critics for decades , the researchers excluded thyroid function as a subject for study . Not surprisingly , this study was funded in part by the infant - formula industry . Most of the fears concerning soy formula have focused on estrogens . There are other problems as well , notably much higher levels of aluminum , fluoride , and manganese than are found in either breastmilk or dairy formulas.90-96 All three metals have the potential to adversely affect brain development . Although trace amounts of manganese are vital to the development of the brain , toxic levels accrued from ingestion of soy formula during infancy have been found in children suffering from attention - deficit disorders , dyslexia , and other learning problems .97 , 98 Soy apologists sometimes argue that the plant hormones in soy formula could not possibly be harmful because Japanese women eat a lot of soy products and so must have high levels of phytoestrogens in their breastmilk .

Democrats do gay rights better . ENDA . Hate crimes legislation . Civil unions . Fighting DOMAs even , although the party is very split on that .

I talk about Democrats doing gay rights better , and I EXPLICITLY EXPLAINED the long list of things that Democrats DO do that Republicans FIGHT AGAINST , and you ignore it with that lame response which TOTALLY IGNORES YOUR CLAIMS on the issue ... Democrats do gay rights better . ENDA . Hate crimes legislation . Civil unions . Fighting DOMAs even , although the party is very split on that . In the states recently that enacted gay marriage , it was due to the Democrats in the state , as the Republicans fought it . So you want to know why Democrats are supported ? You talk about it being `` some reason &apos;&apos; ? I will tell you why gays support Democrats for gay rights . Cause they fight FOR them , and NOT AGAINST them as Republicans do . And I think denying gays equal rights out of interests in protecting `` a word &apos;&apos; is a pretty absurd `` sort - of thing to do &apos;&apos; .

I talk about Democrats doing gay rights better , and I EXPLICITLY EXPLAINED the long list of things that Democrats DO do that Republicans FIGHT AGAINST , and you ignore it with that lame response which TOTALLY IGNORES YOUR CLAIMS on the issue ... Democrats do gay rights better . ENDA . Hate crimes legislation . Civil unions . Fighting DOMAs even , although the party is very split on that . In the states recently that enacted gay marriage , it was due to the Democrats in the state , as the Republicans fought it . So you want to know why Democrats are supported ? You talk about it being `` some reason &apos;&apos; ? I will tell you why gays support Democrats for gay rights . Cause they fight FOR them , and NOT AGAINST them as Republicans do . And I think denying gays equal rights out of interests in protecting `` a word &apos;&apos; is a pretty absurd `` sort - of thing to do &apos;&apos; . Furthermore , I just have to laugh at the big picture here . You have repeatedly complained about those threads , and you CONTINUE TO BRING THEM UP where you can ... emoticon_xdonno You &apos; re like the housewife who runs around saying `` I hate to spread rumors , but did you hear about the latest one that Debbie is telling ? &apos;&apos; emoticon_xdonno It &apos;s funny how I have already explained the relevance to the GAY RIGHTS issue , above and beyond `` tabloids &apos;&apos; , and you ignore it . But YOU bringing up `` tabloids &apos;&apos; for your perspective to be against `` gay pride &apos;&apos; is obviously fine and dandy for you ... emoticon_frazzled As previously quoted , Sanford has already laid out his requirements out on the table . He asked for Clinton to resign . Perhaps Sanford should live up to his expectations of others , and that would show `` sincere remorse &apos;&apos; . Do n&apos;t you think that if somebody says `` Punish him with X cause he did Y &apos;&apos; , and then when he does Y he does n&apos;t follow through with X , that shows hypocrisy and a lack of remorse ? You have a SERIOUS problem with making sudden requests for information , and then treating the FIRST request as somehow a major problem cause it has n&apos;t been answered BEFORE YOU ASKED IT ... It is stupid to complain I am avoiding something you JUST BROUGHT UP ! And cockroaches hide in the dark and run from the light . Go figure ! One of the reasons these posts grow is cause you keep on piling the strawman b.s . I never said anything about this guy NEVER being forgiven . My gawd . At times you are just classically hilarious , cause you twist yourself into so many mental contortions with the obvious effort to criticize others that you do n&apos;t even recognize how absurd you &apos; re being . We &apos; re talking about both situations with a HUSBAND HAVING AN AFFAIR ON A WIFE ! ! ! ! So yeah . I think that no matter how you look at that , the HUSBAND HAVING AN AFFAIR ON A WIFE is doing something bad . OMG ! How could I EVER adhere to such a ridiculously strict standard that I think the bible itself would also agree to ... Tell me Jyoshu . Would the bible have given the cheating husband a pass in either of those situations ? ? ? And you make this with absolutely no basis for your claim . Yet another unsubstantiated claim . FYI ? When Clinton lied , I wanted him kicked out of office . Over time , I have come to realize that the standard would be such that it would effectively eliminate most politicians . I &apos; ve tempered my view . But you have no basis for your claim , other than your typical b.s . of making claims of what people think just cause you think it sounds good for you to say ... emoticon_wow",,395075,"Ah , the pro - gay pride crowd is starting to reference Scripture .

A male simply would not have been able to survive in any such primate group , nor do I believe his seeds would have been able produce others of his type . I think the female egg is far more versatile as to what it accepts to fertilize it . In the event that the catalyst were male , I believe it would only be able to mate compatibly with its own mother . 2 . ) Only a female would be able to care for its young in a way that would allow it to survive . After having this young , she would gaurd it closely . 3 . ) It is not extremely difficult to conceive that a quasihumanoid primate would be able to exist and be fertilized by a similar specie . There are many races and creeds of people in the world today whom are all capable of crossbreeding . Black , white , spanish , eskimo , indian , etc . . .

My thought would be to test human sperm against different groups of primates &apos; eggs .

A male simply would not have been able to survive in any such primate group , nor do I believe his seeds would have been able produce others of his type . I think the female egg is far more versatile as to what it accepts to fertilize it . In the event that the catalyst were male , I believe it would only be able to mate compatibly with its own mother . 2 . ) Only a female would be able to care for its young in a way that would allow it to survive . After having this young , she would gaurd it closely . 3 . ) It is not extremely difficult to conceive that a quasihumanoid primate would be able to exist and be fertilized by a similar specie . There are many races and creeds of people in the world today whom are all capable of crossbreeding . Black , white , spanish , eskimo , indian , etc . . . This indicates that we must all have a single common origin . 4 . ) I &apos; d like to say that the change in dynamic form was radical , retarded actually , and that all of the catalyst &apos;s offspring remained hereditary to her . Perhaps seperating completely from other primate groups . I would also venture to say that the development of our species as far as intelligence and capacity was probably a very slow process . 5 . ) Scientists generally refer to us being more like monkeys as far as IQ and build , though I believe it was apes . I think the first quasihumans were retards of an impotent ape . Segregated from ape culture , the retard children learned from momma and from observing other forms of life . The more intelligent the species became , the more versatile it became . Anyway , that is my conjecture . I am curious to know what reaction takes places when similar species of sperm and eggs meet . Does the sperm cell penetrate the egg ? Is it killed off long before ? Does it try to penetrate and fail ? Does anything happen ? My thought would be to test human sperm against different groups of primates &apos; eggs . My theory is that , if there is even a remnant in existence , that the reaction with human sperm versus the catalyst would be different than any other reaction , even if it failed to produce .

This goes back to Galileo disproving the entrenched church - sanctioned belief that the sun goes round the earth . Nobody thinks anything `` must have evolved &apos;&apos; . We have the theory , proposed by Darwin , added to by others , and we find that the vast majority of evidence supports it , particularly in the field of genetics . The concept of a supernatural cause is literally meaningless to the scientific method , but this does not entail a rejection of spirituality . It does , however entail accepting theories that describe a system to the extent that you can make all sorts of predictions about that system &apos;s behaviour . To me this seems like common sense . It does n&apos;t matter if the theories sound far - fetched , or if they contradict aspects of an entrenched belief , because if the predictions can be repeatedly and consistently demonstrated , how can you question the theory ? You can do it by coming up with a more accurate theory , but that &apos;s the only way . You ca n&apos;t do it by picking holes in unfinished areas of the theory , which , no offense , seems to be a disproprtionately large element of ID and ` creation science &apos; .

For those wanting to see the previous statements made in the thread , you can go here . I do n&apos;t necessarily think that exactly . What I had a problem with was with you saying that what someone thinks ( i.e. me ) is not evidence . As established , it &apos;s wrong by definition . I &apos; m quite sure that many people with agree with it , since it &apos;s the most popular definition of the word . People rarely widely disagree with a definition from a reliable dictionary . Plus , it &apos;s really not for you to change the definition of the word in the dictionary . :) I believe that I have already answered this several times . Yes , of course - there was . Before man roamed the earth there was change and motion , and consequently - there was time . There is a lot of controversy , and really - it &apos;s quite simple . How are you defining sound ? Some definitions of sound suggest that it is only sound when it is heard by humans . If we leave it at this , we &apos; re left with so many questions . What if an animal is there ? What about if you got a tape recorder ? Would it be a sound only when it was played ? What about a deaf person ? Well , at least for this one , by our first definition , our answer should be `` yes &apos;&apos; . Deaf people can pick `` sounds &apos;&apos; since sound is a vibration ( if we define it as that ) . They hear sound with their fingers . Of course , they do not `` hear &apos;&apos; as well , since the ear is much better equipped for such things . sound1 P Pronunciation Key ( sound ) n. 1 . a. Vibrations transmitted through an elastic solid or a liquid or gas , with frequencies in the approximate range of 20 to 20,000 hertz , capable of being detected by human organs of hearing . http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sound By this more appropriate definition , the tree falling in the wood does indeed make a `` sound &apos;&apos; . Matter density - it has everything to do with it . It all depends on the density of matter and energy in the Universe . It will either keep on expanding forever or it will be gravitationally slowed and will eventually collapse back on itself , sometimes called the `` big crunch &apos;&apos; . About the Atom . You &apos; re right , people since Democritus thought that the atom was the smallest thing in the Universe . And at the time , that was the definition for the smallest thing . However , we must not forget that definitions change over time . If you check the definition of it now , you will see that it says nothing of the sort in the definition . The smallest thing , as far as I know , is a singularity . I can understand what you &apos; re trying to say about the Universe . Many scientists , even today , can not fathom that the Universe is `` expanding &apos;&apos; but into nothing - which is n&apos;t something . It just does n&apos;t seem to make sense . To try to provide an answer , some said it &apos;s expanding into `` hyperspace &apos;&apos; - which is more or less now considered a fictional thing , except in Star Trek . ;) I think it &apos;s also used in M - theory , but it &apos;s just the space between branes . Other said , `` it &apos;s expanding into another dimension &apos;&apos; , which has n&apos;t proved to be too credible either . Before I go on , we want to be careful of what we mean by `` expanding &apos;&apos; . Expanding is probably even the wrong word to use . Planets , suns and solar systems are n&apos;t expanding . Even space itself is not expanding . All we know is that galaxies are moving further and further away from each other . And the further they are to us , the faster they &apos; re going . Like I have said , it is hard for us to use empirical methods to find out whether there is something `` outside &apos;&apos; . As the classic big bang theory goes , there is not spatial boundary - no point that you can go to and say , hey ! this is the boundary ! However , although there is no spatial boundary , evidence suggests that it is spatially finite . Refer to the analogy with a 2d ant on a 3d model above . The thing about multiple dimensions and multiverses is that they &apos; re all well and good but all such ideas are currently not testable and so can not be regarded as anything more than speculation . We ca n&apos;t really say anything about them - and there are too many questions that arise . There is a lot of possibility , but no common understanding - more like science fiction . We can say that there are other `` universes &apos;&apos; that all exist in `` hyperspace &apos;&apos; , but we really have no reason to believe so . If time began at the big bang , then what ? Are there different dimensions of time for different Universes ? What happens when two Universes `` expand into each other &apos;&apos; ? Is `` hyperspace &apos;&apos; infinite ? Just how do you intend on reaching it if there is no possible access to it ? Like I said , the Universe is curved . If you go forward for ever and ever you &apos; ll get back to where you started .",,Control_21,"Dr. LaRusso is a former President and Chairman of the Board of the Florida Chiropractic Society(FCS ) , the smaller of two groups that chiropractors in Florida can belong to ( the other is the Fla.

I would credit a hunter - gatherer as an expert on tracks . No need to have a PhD . However , leaving aside your obsession with degree qualifications , a biologist might have specialised in dentition , and I would not suggest that this would qualify them to give expert comment on tracks . You simply assume that he is a biologist who a ) studied tracks or animal locomotion ( in his degree ) and b ) geology as he comments on both . If he &apos; d grown up in the bush , with frequent recourse to hunting , I &apos; d have accepted him as an ` expert &apos; on tracks . I made no stated assumptions , other then I feel that if he has n&apos;t listed his qualifications it is because he &apos;s not qualified . I agree that this is an assumption on my part , for he may well be an ` expert in tracks &apos; . If he is , I would concede this point . But I stated from the beginning that I came to this article as it is , and on reading it , judged it as it is . If you are aware of other articles that expand on his qualifications you would have saved a lot of time by quoting them earlier ... so that these articles could be presented and judged . As it stands you just make an assumption about these qualifications , and I ca n&apos;t , as I &apos; ve not seen the evidence ... Funny that you &apos; re the evolutionist basing your beliefs on faith , and I &apos; m the creationist demanding to see the evidence . He has published numerous articles , therefore he is an expert , is the argument you make now . Let &apos;s again look to what he did when fresh out of university , he stated he was a biologist . Full stop , nothing else . He then studied the tracks , and has published on them . You raise him to ` expert &apos; , when right from the beginning he fails to live up to this . You try the ` numbers &apos; game ... a lot of people agree , therefore it &apos;s true , a lot of articles written , therefore they &apos; re true . Should you finally produce some conclusive evidence , say , his qualifications , then this matter might be resolved - excepting that you &apos; ve been holding out on nothing but faith all this time . It is because you are giving him abilities that he has not stated . He quite simply says ... student of biology . To you that means he &apos;s qualified to give expertise not only on track formation , but geology as well . In fact , you &apos; ve retrospectively given him the mantle of expert . If he &apos;s been studying tracks 50 years , or so , I wo n&apos;t specify a specific time , he could be said to be an expert ... but fresh out of university , he made these conclusions , and he &apos;s not wavered . He was , then , an expert from day 1 ( according to you ) . And , according to you he &apos;s able to detect human involvement - that is forgery . You base this simply on the wish that it was so . You said clearly ... Quite clearly you are arguing that , aside from being a lone voice on the issue , other people have come to the same conclusions , you even suggested most creationists , but fail to site any evidence to support that later claim . I am still waiting . It is all well and good of you to try to suggest something about the minds of creationists , but I &apos; m afraid that mind - reading is not my forte . You make so many just - so statements and expect people to believe it . He has done the same , and you believe him . You are making arguments based on numbers . Are they given to making the same just - so arguments he makes ? Just because he &apos;s no expert , and writes a dozen articles , does n&apos;t make him any more an expert . Others doing the same thing , if that is what is happening , equally adds no weight to the argument . 1 x1 x1 x1 is still one , no matter how many 1 &apos;s you add to it , it just does n&apos;t get bigger . What qualifications do they have ? What writings have they presented ? Are the people making the claims about man - made tracks less qualified ? You seem to think so . Indeed , a just - so statement was made , and accepted by you unless you are prepared to show me the creationist sites you &apos; ve read this on . Are they representative of all creationists ? I am a creationist , I do n&apos;t have a web - site ... how was my opinion factored into the equation ? Many of my friends equally are creationists , and none of them have web - sites either . I do n&apos;t believe that they were polled . I &apos; ll go check , I do n&apos;t want to make an assumption as you have . ( they also have n&apos;t posted on web - site debts - so you &apos; re ability to read their minds astounds me ) . You tell me your criteria for surveying , and I can tell if it &apos;s enough . Otherwise it &apos;s another just - so argument that you simply take as ` fact &apos; . Ah , now we &apos; re not talking about creationists , but creationist experts . You say that there &apos;s no qualification to being a track expert , so how are you going to figure out which creationists to ask ? He generally refers not to experts , but creationists in general ... `` By this time a growing number of creationists were becoming disenchanted with Baugh?s methods and claims ... &apos;&apos; Which is it you are talking about ? Not at all . I &apos; ve already dealt with this statement of his , and found it rather naive for him to think that any right - thinking person would believe it to be so ... it is the type of thing you believe - that a scientist is above personal bias . Logic says this fella is a biologist with an evolutionists bent . He claims that he was prepared to go along and make a judgement that might have undermined all notions of Darwinism ( with regards time - scale ) that he &apos; d ever been taught . I am making an assumption here , but it seems so ludicrous that he would be that sort of exceptional person , especially in light of the fact that he &apos;s prepared to comment on factors he &apos;s not stated he &apos;s an expert in . It just seems too arrogant . I am assuming that he , like you makes just - so arguments to be factual . Very likely he makes assumptions based on numbers of ` experts &apos; rather than facts ... though this of course is just a guess on my part . Based on what expertise ? As I said earlier , if a creationist scientist comments outside his field , he is lampooned . You see no problem with this biologist making comments on geology ... even if he studied it , he would n&apos;t necessarily be an expert . I studied Irish , and I ca n&apos;t speak it . Nil thuigimm e. * You give him credit simply based on the fact that he &apos;s a scientist , and he &apos;s published a work that agree with you ... so you add in details that are n&apos;t present . He may well have studied tracks all his life , I do n&apos;t know . He does n&apos;t state this , and as I said at the very beginning , I am only able to judge this work by the work itself . You have some special insight that transcends my capabilities . He said some of the tracks were dinosaur tracks , but also some were forged , and some were geological depressions . Even within the category of dinosaur tracks , some were straight out caused by dinosaurs tails , some by their snouts , and `` Some were mud - collapsed &apos;&apos; dinosaur tracks . Which is what I stated earlier , a whole range of phenomena were concerned in the creation of these ` tracks &apos; besides the normal phenomena for the agreed dinosaur tracks . This is quite extraordinary , as well , he seems to have stumbled on a dinosaur which just happens to have a special walking gait to account for these other ` tracks &apos; . You then argue that even if he was n&apos;t an expert , he collaborated with a whole lot of other people , who must have been experts * I &apos; ve got `` Teach Yourself Gaelic &apos;&apos; plus all the notes etc from university , and I &apos; m still unable to converse",,2_Moderately_Formal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,1_Slightly_Formal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,3_Very_Formal,,3_Very_Formal,,3_Very_Formal,,2_Moderately_Formal,,,,,,,

You provide documentation to back up your opinion , even if it the opinion of one who is considered an authority . You and I are not authorities so we refer to authorities .

Logic is good if your assumptions are good . If you have bad assumptions you can still be very logical and come to the wrong conclusion .

Why do kids that attend private schools do better then public school kids statistically ? Its the home . I &apos; ll use two kids as an example . One we &apos; ll call Darin ( ME ) . Darin grew up in a middle - upper income house . His parents both worked and money while tight was n&apos;t in short supply . Darin went to public schools in a middle income neighborhood .

Eventually he dropped out of high school and at this time he STILL lives with his parents and cleans office buildings at night part - time . OK , two kids , same IQ ( or close ) , same schools , same teachers , same financial situation ... ... . . two very different outcomes . Darin did well because of his parents . They taught him the value of an education and ALWAYS made sure it was a priority . They accepted the responsibility for having a child and raised him with morals , a sense of duty and responsibility . Darin learned the value of hardwork from his father who earned his BS at age 44 and his mother who went back to school in her early 50 &apos;s to become an RN . Darin carried this sense of responsibility into school each day . Brian on the other hand had two parents who were `` average &apos;&apos; at best . They really did n&apos;t watch out for Brian ( or his brother and sister who are also as messed up as he is ) and did n&apos;t press him to do anything . So absorbed in thier own lives they had some kids and then forgot about them . They never sat down and talked to them . They never helped them with homework . They never instilled that sense of `` I CAN &apos;&apos; into them . It would be easy to blame the schools for Brians failure but we really ca n&apos;t . Keep in mind we have situations like this in poor districts as well . Some kids , raised by a single mother , who end up going to Yale or Harvard ; while other kids at the SAME SCHOOL end up in prison or dead .

I for one , do n&apos;t like to see justice done as it was in the Tiller case ( outside the law ) but it does n&apos;t bother me all that much . I do n&apos;t feel pleasure , or comfort , but I do get just a little satisfaction knowing that Tiller will never kill again . The opposite happens - ~ I ~ get very devastated and disoriented when , for example , a 30 year old mom ( with a few kids and hard working husband who are home sleeping ) is out for a Saturday morning jog and gets clobbered in the head and instantly killed with a crowbar by a street punk hiding in bushes along the sidewalk , and robbed of the $ 20 she had on her . Our leftist friends feel as much compassion for her as I do for Tiller . They &apos; re not glad - they do n&apos;t feel pleasure or comfort , it &apos;s just something that happens in this world , no big deal to them . But they do get just a little satisfaction knowing that the street punk just got $ 20 that he did n&apos;t earn , and they love wealth redistribution . He &apos; ll probably buy drugs and booze with it - another plus for them . It &apos;s just a difference in worldviews between us and them - they &apos; ll never understand us and we &apos; ll never understand them .",,426508,"Could you express the idea coherently ? e.g. `` The more I read the more I think libertarians are the cause of the problem because ______________________ &apos;&apos; I do not see regulation as able to `` solve &apos;&apos; the problem , because the underlying cause of bubbles is the federal reserve pumping credit out . As long as this continues , you will have a bubble . If you stop bubbles in one industry , they will simply explode in another - they do not belong to one industry or sector .",,107027,"Let me clarify what I have previously posted . This is not about racism , but about the sad state of affairs within the Black community . It is no more or no less than what Bill Cosby has stated . Blacks comprise only app . 13 % of America &apos;s population yet : 1 . That 13 % accounts for 80 % of all violent crime . 2 . The number one cause of death in Black males between the ages of 17 and 40 is gun - shot wounds . 3 . That same 13 % of the population comprises 50 % of all new aids cases in America . 4 . One half of that 13 % ( Black males ) make up over 40 % of America &apos;s prison population . I could go on and on , but to what end ? The truth is that there is a huge problem in the Black community with drugs and crime . I personally do not believe that poverty is the root cause of crime . There may be many excuses for these problems , but very few real reasons . Some people just do n&apos;t give a damn about themselves or other people and intend to prove it . I believe that a lack of decent morals and rampant drug abuse in the Black community is at the root of most of their problems . The fact that 70 % of the children born in the Black community are illegitimate bolsters my theory that a lack of decent morals is prevalent in that community . I believe that liberals are largely the cause of these problems . President Johnson &apos;s Great Society comes to mind as one of the greatest failures in American history . Affirmative action and welfare does not liberate , it enslaves people . That failed social exercise made a whole race of Americans quit caring about themselves and their families . The solution to the problem is within the heart of every individual regardless of their skin color . Throwing money at these problems only makes things worse . Boot straps or food stamps are an individual choice .",,379136,"Michigan is in the poor house because it &apos;s been run by liberals for so long . Same with New York , New Jersey , California , etc . , etc . . How many millions of innocent babies have you flaming liberals aborted ? You want to know why your vaunted France is a 2nd rate country these days ? Because they &apos; ve turned their backs on God . Instead you &apos; ve surrended to the Devil .",,2344,"Actually looking at the situation it has little to do with teachers and everything to do with homelife . I know something about this topic ( and I &apos; m running for our school board next year ) . Schools are failing those children who are being failed at home . What does that mean exactly ? Look at the situation . Why do we have 4.0 gpa honor students from ghetto schools attending Harvard ? Why do we have 1.5 gpa students from rich white suburban school districts failing classes ? Why do kids that attend private schools do better then public school kids statistically ? Its the home . I &apos; ll use two kids as an example . One we &apos; ll call Darin ( ME ) . Darin grew up in a middle - upper income house . His parents both worked and money while tight was n&apos;t in short supply . Darin went to public schools in a middle income neighborhood . When he got home he had to study and do homework before anything else . Even though he was a `` latch - key &apos;&apos; kid and he came home to an empty house Darin made use of his time and managed his schoolwork . If there was something he did n&apos;t understand he &apos; d wait til his folks got home and ask them . Darin went on to graduate from high school and entered the US Navy as a `` Nuc &apos;&apos; on submarines . After six years he was discharged and went to college . He earned above average grades and joined MENSA . Leaving college he started a home - based web services company while working nights at a Walmart as a stocker . His business grew and he eventually quit Walmart . He now has a nice house , 12 employees and a successful company with some very hi - profile customers . Now let &apos;s talk about Darins best friend Brian ( MY FRIEND ) . Brian had two parents who while living together really did n&apos;t seem to have a clue . He lived in a nice house ( same floorplan as Darins in fact ) and his parents made about the same money as Darins . He went to the same schools and had the same teachers most of the time . Yet Brian never excelled . He scored higher then Darin on tests ( he was very smart ) but he just did n&apos;t work at anything . He fumbled through jr . high , started drugs and was arrested several times . Eventually he dropped out of high school and at this time he STILL lives with his parents and cleans office buildings at night part - time . OK , two kids , same IQ ( or close ) , same schools , same teachers , same financial situation ... ... . . two very different outcomes . Darin did well because of his parents . They taught him the value of an education and ALWAYS made sure it was a priority . They accepted the responsibility for having a child and raised him with morals , a sense of duty and responsibility . Darin learned the value of hardwork from his father who earned his BS at age 44 and his mother who went back to school in her early 50 &apos;s to become an RN . Darin carried this sense of responsibility into school each day . Brian on the other hand had two parents who were `` average &apos;&apos; at best . They really did n&apos;t watch out for Brian ( or his brother and sister who are also as messed up as he is ) and did n&apos;t press him to do anything . So absorbed in thier own lives they had some kids and then forgot about them . They never sat down and talked to them . They never helped them with homework . They never instilled that sense of `` I CAN &apos;&apos; into them . It would be easy to blame the schools for Brians failure but we really ca n&apos;t . Keep in mind we have situations like this in poor districts as well . Some kids , raised by a single mother , who end up going to Yale or Harvard ; while other kids at the SAME SCHOOL end up in prison or dead . It &apos;s got nothing to do with schools and teachers and money . It has everything to do with PARENTING .

If he is unable to do either , then I &apos; d guess that he was n&apos;t being underpaid and was being paid at a rate , determined by a free market , to be commensurate with the skill level required for the job . ( In actuality , that &apos;s not entirely true . The existence of a minimum wage law tampers with the free market . ) Right now , there are more government workers than those employed in manufacturing .

Those that can afford to pay their share of the bill = 1/200 , 000,000 of the Federal budget ( not counting kids ) can pay it in cash . For example , if we set the Federal Budget at $ 1Trillion , your fair share would be $ 5000 . If you can afford $ 5000 , then you pay it in cash . If you ca n&apos;t , you work for Uncle Sam at a rate of say $ 10/hr , so that &apos;s 500 hours of service , maximum . That &apos;s less than 10 hours per week to pay your fair share of running the country . Today , the average worker works until some date in May to pay his taxes , so this is a net savings of time and money . The added benefit of my plan is the displacement of Federal employees . Imagine the number of Federal Employees that would be replaced with , essentially , free labor . That would further reduce the cost to run the Federal Government which would reduce the individual &apos;s share of the burden which would further lower the number of hours of mandatory service . Variations of the theme could be employers getting some `` free labor &apos;&apos; from someone paying their fair share and the employer paying Uncle Sam . Huh ? What sort of nonsense are you saying ? A job &apos;s value is determined by the wage in which it pays . If it does n&apos;t pay `` enough &apos;&apos; in a free market , then it goes unfilled . The fact that it &apos;s filled says that someone believes that it &apos;s a fair wage . So , in the beginning of the paragraph , you state that the employer pays the lowest possible rate but at the end of the paragraph you say that promotions and raises distort the free market by making the employee NOT want to leave . WOW ! emoticon_wow What the hell are you saying ? The free market is n&apos;t maintained because good workers are compensated at a higher rate than they were initially paid ? Does n&apos;t that indicate that their value to the employer went up and therefore to keep them , so did their wages ? That &apos;s exactly what a free market does . It rewards performance . Monopolies are n&apos;t necessarily bad things . Utility companies have monopolies and until fairly recently , so did the phone company . These were granted to promote growth in the electric and telephone grid . If there were no monopolies , would electric companies compete to run 5 miles of cable to a single house in the middle of nowhere ? Of course not . By giving a company a monopoly WITH STRINGS , companies were able to undertake non - profitable tasks as long as they made a profit overall . Without the monopoly , that house would still be in the dark . ( I know , lots of money came from the REA ) The biggest problem with public education is that it IS a monopoly ... but that &apos;s a topic for another thread . Capitalism has a much greater chance of success than communism because of the very nature of the rewards vs risks .",,2_Moderately_Formal,,-3_Very_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-2_Moderately_Informal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,0_Neither,,-1_Slightly_Informal,,0_Neither,,-3_Very_Informal,,,,,,,,,,

You should cease projecting your own non - argument style onto other people . Now for the mix - up ... I think you are both trying to be cute here . Unkerpaulie hit the nail on the head . Here &apos;s what one evolutionist site says ... `` Q : I thought evolution was just a theory . Why do you call it a fact ? A : Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time . That this happens is a fact . Biological evolution also refers to the common descent of living organisms from shared ancestors . The evidence for historical evolution -- genetic , fossil , anatomical , etc . -- is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact . The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution . So evolution is both a fact and a theory . &apos;&apos; http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs - qa.html Here &apos;s another ... `` A century &apos;s accumulation of such evidence establishes descent , with modification , from common ancestors as a fact of science . How we explain this fact &amp;#8212 ; what the principles and causes of it may be &amp;#8212 ; is the theory of evolutionary process , parts of which are subject to various amounts of scientific debate , modification , and extension . &apos;&apos; http://evonet.sdsc.edu/evoscisociety/evolu_fact_theo.htm Evolutionists argue that it is a fact . Evolution is taught as being true . The arguments against teaching creation in schools in part rested on the ` truthfulness &apos; of evolution . That &apos;s what evolutionists in general argue . Specifically , here &apos;s what you two have said ... Post 28 you use an analogy to show that regardless of the theories , the fact ( in this case , geese fly south ) happens to be true . Post 33 Thus , for you evolution is based on the evidence . ( By the way , I thought you &apos; d left this thread ! Post 37 ) Post 35 Thus , for you , it is true . Post 39 Mach says I , unlike he , do not require evidence to know what is true . The implication here is that he knows what is true , because of the evidence . In fact he &apos;s said it so many times in so many ways that he believes I have faith - which for him is based on lack of evidence , again implying he knows the opposite of faith ; fact , based on the evidence . If either of you wish to state that evolution is not true , but is based on evidences that you &apos; re not sure about , you &apos; re welcome to clarify your positions .

Your question assumes certain irrational assumptions which speak volumes regarding your very flawed world view . You ca n&apos;t have it both ways and imply that your questions do n&apos;t say a lot about your warped and uninformed opinion of reality . All you have to offer is a lot of self deluded and shallow rantings that make no sense to anyone with even an ounce of theological understanding . You claim that no observable evidence for God exists , but when I offer it you will only scoff and refer to your religion of evolution while ignoring the perfectly symbiotic chain of life that exists before your own eyes . Your religion of evolution boldly claims that all life arose from chaotically formed random mutations on an otherwise dead planet , yet allegedly , from that chaos came this marvelous and organized creation which is self replicating and self sustaining at every level of life upon it . You are so brainwashed and deluded that you prefer the lie to the truth of how you came to be and what your place is in this Creation under God who created us in His image . And what is most perplexing is that you humanists who claim to embrace science and the scientific method are too blind to see that your chosen secular religion of evolution ignores the very scientific principles it claims to be founded upon . You defend a school of thought that is completely man made and fraudulent yet you defend it as if it is actually founded in reality . Simply put , the best evidence I have for the reality of God is the symbiotic earth itself which He created . But you will deny that evidence as you believe the inconsistent rationale that an organized earth formed and blossomed from a disorganized and chaotic beginning that allegedly began through totally random mutations on an otherwise dead planet . Go figure , huh ? Evolution is a so called science that determined the outcome based on Darwin &apos;s delusion before any real or actual evidence ever existed to prove any of it . Since that fraudulent founding , this so called science has existed to prove that preconceived fairy tale . Never did one iota of actual evidence exist that proved any of the principles upon which evolution is founded to exist prior to the creation of the industry dedicated to justifying this false religion/philosophy that explains how man allegedly evolved from lower animals so it could erase GOD from the equation of how man came to exist on Earth . Also , my standing challenge for evidence that evolution is a tried , tested and proven theory still stands if anyone is interested in offering actual evidence rather than cheap lip service , ok ?",,Control_16,Thank you Mori for your thoughtful recommendation .,Formal,418743,"I grow sick hearing things like this . .

Van der Kamp , Dec. 27 , 1816 `` God is an essence that we know nothing of . Until this awful blasphemy is got rid of , there will never be any liberal science in the world . &apos;&apos; `` This would be the best of all possible worlds , if there were no religion in it . &apos;&apos; .

Of all the animosities which have existed among mankind , those which are caused by the difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing , and ought most to be depreciated .

When you answered with `` they &apos; re &apos;&apos; , after I asked you for your belief , I took the only thing you answered with . Thanks for clarifying though that it is your belief as well . Since you say it was , then I was correct to make the assumption , no ? As the old saying goes , the devil is in the details . IMO , it &apos;s easy to take a vague stance on something without addressing specifics , but I find that it is in the specifics where it becomes a real - world issue . I &apos; m interested in how things like this will play out in a realistic sense . Also , I did make pretty clear that I agree with the letter in a personal sense , so yes I do indeed agree there &apos;s problem there , at least with SOME evangelical leaders ( certainly not all of them ) . So again , would you care to address specifically how do we determine if a religious leader is participating as a `` church leader &apos;&apos; or as a `` private citizen &apos;&apos; in any given case ? It seems to me this is a pretty important issue . The different approach is the one I am taking -- that I would n&apos;t support such a letter for the reasons I &apos; ve described in post # 26 . So you feel that tax - exempt laws , as they are , are all the determining factor we need in how to tell if a religious leader is acting as a private citizen or as a church leader when they participate in politics ? What laws do you have in mind ? I &apos; d be interested in knowing . The only thing I know of is that it is my understanding that a church can not endorse a political candidate or a pastor can not do so in the pulpit . I know of no law saying they can not support a specific piece of legislation .

Milo : All these things are conceivable , but the real question is , are they reasonable ? -- &lt; If you wish to discuss reasonability , then you &apos; ve got a much bigger task to show the bible is reasonable than I do to show that it &apos;s conceivable that Jesus may not have been historical . Was it reasonable to believe in black holes 100 years ago ? No , but you do today . Why ? Because you were shown the evidence . Was it reasonable to believe that man would go to the moon 200 years ago ? No . You believe it today because you saw the evidence . Do n&apos;t get silly on me here . You &apos; re kidding right ? See post 146 in which I point out much of the documented extra Biblical evidence that supports its claims . You &apos; ll need to read my posts more carefully if you want the answers to your questions . Just stating they have n&apos;t been an answered is silly . You just look foolish when you do so . I said something about Darwinism . It is relevant to our discussion , as it is to this thread . If you wish to disregard the comparison you can do that , but it &apos;s still a vaild comparison and we are ( or should be ) addressing evolution . Are you embarrassed by it ? Yes . That &apos;s why evidence is provided . Agreed . I &apos; m saying there is objective evidence that supports the historical evidence of the writings of the Bible . Enough of that evidence has been provided and verified for one to believe it is a true and accurated document . See post # 146 . Agreed , but not without evidence that has been verified by outside sources . See post # 146 . It shows supernatural influence , especially when combined with the way it was written . Show me another example that can stand up to the method the books were put together , as I gave above , with the writings having been compiled over 1500 years , by 40 different authors , each with different backgrounds , in three different languages , over three continents , yet all with one unified message , and I &apos; ll take a look at it . See post # 146 Show me one contradiction that ca n&apos;t be argued sucessfully ? One contradiction that has n&apos;t been answered ? If you can , then maybe that contradiction is valid . If you ca n&apos;t , then there &apos;s no reason to believe it &apos;s any more valid than the assertion itself . See post # 146 . You really need to read it .

I recall that Justice Thurgood Marshall , Judge Connie Baker Motley , the first black woman appointed to the federal bench , and others of the NAACP argued Brown v. Board of Education .

I am not so sure Justice O&apos;Connor is the author of that line since Professor Resnik attributes that line to Supreme Court Justice Coyle . I am also not so sure that I agree with the statement .

Second , I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n&apos;t lived that life . Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society .

I , like Professor Carter , believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group . Many are so capable . As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to me , nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done so on many occasions and on many issues including Brown . However , to understand takes time and effort , something that not all people are willing to give . For others , their experiences limit their ability to understand the experiences of others .

And , she wishes minorities and women to know that they have something very valuable to contribute , based on their experiences as minorities or women . ---------------- In our private conversations , Judge Cedarbaum has pointed out to me that seminal decisions in race and sex discrimination cases have come from Supreme Courts composed exclusively of white males . I agree that this is significant but I also choose to emphasize that the people who argued those cases before the Supreme Court which changed the legal landscape ultimately were largely people of color and women . I recall that Justice Thurgood Marshall , Judge Connie Baker Motley , the first black woman appointed to the federal bench , and others of the NAACP argued Brown v. Board of Education . Similarly , Justice Ginsburg , with other women attorneys , was instrumental in advocating and convincing the Court that equality of work required equality in terms and conditions of employment . Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences , a possibility I abhor less or discount less than my colleague Judge Cedarbaum , our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging . Justice O&apos;Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise old man and wise old woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases . I am not so sure Justice O&apos;Connor is the author of that line since Professor Resnik attributes that line to Supreme Court Justice Coyle . I am also not so sure that I agree with the statement . First , as Professor Martha Minnow has noted , there can never be a universal definition of wise . Second , I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n&apos;t lived that life . Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society . Until 1972 , no Supreme Court case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender discrimination case . I , like Professor Carter , believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group . Many are so capable . As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to me , nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done so on many occasions and on many issues including Brown . However , to understand takes time and effort , something that not all people are willing to give . For others , their experiences limit their ability to understand the experiences of others . Other simply do not care . Hence , one must accept the proposition that a difference there will be by the presence of women and people of color on the bench . Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see . My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar . I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging . But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage . I also hope that by raising the question today of what difference having more Latinos and Latinas on the bench will make will start your own evaluation . For people of color and women lawyers , what does and should being an ethnic minority mean in your lawyering ? For men lawyers , what areas in your experiences and attitudes do you need to work on to make you capable of reaching those great moments of enlightenment which other men in different circumstances have been able to reach . For all of us , how do change the facts that in every task force study of gender and race bias in the courts , women and people of color , lawyers and judges alike , report in significantly higher percentages than white men that their gender and race has shaped their careers , from hiring , retention to promotion and that a statistically significant number of women and minority lawyers and judges , both alike , have experienced bias in the courtroom ?

And if you do n&apos;t have it , then do n&apos;t ask . And tell Brigid not to bother whining about it anymore either .",,200308,"I respect people who , whilst believing their own faith to be true , can accept there are other people out there who have a very different ideology , and are equally as entitled to it . I am perfectly secure in my own faith . I am also secure in the knowledge that many many people will disagree with me on it . For me my faith is the truth , for you yours is . I can accept that and understand it , that is all I &apos; m asking ... edit : Apologies , I read your line as ` sounds pretty insecure &apos; at first . The point still stands though .",,221338,"one of the definitions of servitude on dictionary.com is : `` Lack of personal freedom , as to act as one chooses . &apos;&apos; Kids are forced to sit in a classroom , walk to the next , do homework outside of school , and even Constitutionally do n&apos;t have as many rights while in school . How much more before it becomes servitude ? BTW , I figure even if it is n&apos;t compulsory it will still have a lot of kids go since it &apos;s their parents &apos; decision . Similarly look at college . It would become necessary to complete just like college to get a decent job anywhere .",,242161,"Here is a prime example of what I am saying in the following post . http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=242081&amp;postcount=6 Notice EZ does not quote Jesus he quotes Leviticus , not relevent to the christian , and Paul also not relevent since Paul is not Jesus . Let &apos;s here from Jesus on the subject of wealth KJV matthew 19:23 -24 Ez sometimes forgets that in capitalism money is made on the sweat of others . Others sow and the business owner reaps . So the rich business owner who pays slave wages or tries to pay the least amount to his workers will definitly bring on Jesus &apos;s wrath .",,369300,"Nope . I do n&apos;t think it goes far enough . It &apos;s unconstitutional , and therefore a civil rights violation . Stopping a man who is acting lawfully merely because he has a gun is no less a civil rights violation than stopping a man acting lawfully merely because he is black . The only difference between the two is this : The first cop &apos;s irrational fear is of a man who dares to exercise a protected right he does not like , while the latter &apos;s irrational fear is based upon the color of another man &apos;s skin . Lawfully carrying a firearm is no more a crime than driving while black is . Period . People who call themselves `` liberals &apos;&apos; are traditionally considered defenders of individual liberty . Yet gun control is traditionally a `` liberal &apos;&apos; issue , while protecting individual gun rights is traditionally a `` conservative &apos;&apos; issue . How in God &apos;s name have so many `` liberals &apos;&apos; strayed so far from their otherwise guiding principles that on the issue of gun control they let drop the torch of individual liberty only to have it picked up and re - lit by `` conservatives &apos;&apos; ? These are strange times indeed when we see `` liberals &apos;&apos; having to be lectured by `` conservatives &apos;&apos; about the value of individual liberty . Let me gently remind my otherwise `` liberal &apos;&apos; but gun control loving friends : The end you seek can not justify the means . -- `` The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism , the expediency of the passing hour , the erosion of small encroachments , the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles , by enshrining them in constitutions , and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders . &apos;&apos; Justice Benjamin Cardozo , The Nature of the Judicial Process , Lecture II , 1921 . `` Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government &apos;s purposes are beneficent . Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil - minded rulers .

Assault weapons at the moment do n&apos;t have a accurate definition . I &apos; m simply going on high rate of fire usually with large caliber rounds . AKA a SAW . Then you &apos; d have no problem if we made it inoperable then . emoticon_xhoho And you have proof of this ? But at the same time pack large rounds with high rates of fire . Explain to me how a gun that can litterally mow down people is less dangerous then a gun that at maximum can kill 15-25 people assuming the shooter has absolultely perfect aim . Oh boy , a extremist . Assuming the helicopter does n&apos;t launch missiles at you long before it &apos;s in range . That also assumes the pilot is n&apos;t straffing you with his multiple machine guns and is n&apos;t firing salvos of short range missiles at you . Mighty big assumptions . As for the tank , that all assumes you are n&apos;t simply crushed by the tank , not killed by the main gun , not mowed down by the initial attack , and will actually fire back at a fully automatic machine gun that &apos;s pointed at you . Besides , work is being down to control the machine gun from below . They already have it on Hummers . Are you actually supporting owning weapons designed for war as a civilian ? Remind me not to live by you . Irrevelant to gun control . It only worked because we supplied them top of the line military grade weapons . Exactly how can a machine gun take out a plane that is not only flying at MACH 2 , but is several thousand feet above you ? Who said anything but recommending ? Often with the support of a foreign power . And how are you suppose to take out a 90 ton tank that has infantry and air support ? As for the bomber , if they considered you a threat , and if they were tyrannical , odds are , it &apos;s carpet bombing time . We did n&apos;t do that in Iraq for OBVIOUS reasons . Your point is only valid if the government is trying to keep collateral damage down and wants to keep the populace in its favor . A tyrannical govenment does n&apos;t care either . True , but we still have some rational , fiscal conseravatives in power . Not many , defintitely not in the whitehouse , but they are still there . However , we do know where 60 % of the money is going . It &apos;s mandated by law . Simply go look it up . it &apos;s not like 80 % was going into black ops .

But a recent event unfolding in my life has lead me to the conclusion that fear is much more complex than this and can come from many places other than simple ignorance . In the first place , people are not always afraid of things that are bad . For example , some people are afraid of success . Others become afraid when they feel strong romantic feelings for another person . This seems to spit in the face of logic . Why would a person spend their whole life lamenting their lonely life , only to run in fear when they finally find somebody to love ? But at the same time , anybody who has been hopelessly in love can understand . When you love somebody that much , they have power over you , and that is scary . In my opinion , these feelings do n&apos;t really boil down to ignorance , but I suppose I could be wrong . Sometimes I wish that love really was enough .

They ARE reading it properly ... as are you . Because it &apos;s ALL SUBJECTIVE . In the following statement , you dismiss swaths of the bible as irrelvent to YOU . Focusing on the handful of parts that ring true to you . I &apos; d say they ring true because they also coincide with current moralistic and political beliefs embraced in most of western societies . The Samaritan story being one of compassion to those who are different from you and could traditionally be an enemy . Abundant forgiveness and charity to those in need being common ideas in a society of abundance that happens to be very cosmopolitan so the need to accept the xenos with tolerance exist ... least we tear ourselves in strife .

Are you a hypocrit ? Do you possess some virtue or talent that elevates you above all the others in identifying what the TRUTH ( tm ) is when it comes to biblical exegesis ? I do n&apos;t think so . In the end , most people here , including us militant atheists , also accept some of the more ` liberal &apos; and forgiving attitudes expressed in the bible . It &apos;s just that we can come to those conclusions based on other factors that do n&apos;t include an imaginary sky critter speaking through human emmissaries with a ` because I said so &apos; command . The bible also includes a lot of barbarism and utter nonsense . Why waste the time sifting through it for some little gem that exists in other mediums . `` Mom , the bible says to forgive people who do bad things . Why ? &apos;&apos; ` Honey , it &apos;s because that &apos;s the right thing to do . &apos; `` Why mom ? &apos;&apos; ` Because god says so through his perfect and unchanging word . You would n&apos;t want to displease god would you ? &apos; `` No ...

No one would do that . It &apos;s insane to even think about . &apos; `` But ... erm ... uhh ... but I thought gods word was unchanging and perfect ... &apos;&apos; And out little sweetie wanders off in confusion and develops a psychosis or three and learns that hypocritical and irrational thought and behavior is acceptable . . and encouraged . That double standards are godly standards . As to the discussion on evil man . The bible repeatedly and 100 % pushes the notion that Man is a fallen creature and full of evil sin and wrong doing and that UNLESS he accepts a nonexistant entity as a blood sacrifice to himself as payment for those sins , the RIGHT and JUST punishment for a corrupted man is to be tossed into a lake of fire for all eternity . There is no two - ways about that belief system as easily identified in the bible . SOME , liberal , self - described Christians , do not believe in such ... but , they are easily noted for ignoring vast swayths of the bible too .

Dred Scott was decided based on nothing , not substantive due process or even a form of it . In fact , the 14th amendment ( which is the only due process clause thought to have a substantive component ) was n&apos;t even around then . English jurists . . you should probably add that part . They , however , did n&apos;t write the 14th amendment nor does it matter what Blackstones thoughts on it would have been . If you want to go by `` intent &apos;&apos; of the people that wrote it then read some of the early verisons of the amendment . Most of them did n&apos;t include `` due process &apos;&apos; which was also referred to as `` due course &apos;&apos; ( which Blackstone used as well ) . During the debates it was talked about as a procedural guarntee and it was only added for the ending of the debate . Actually , it does n&apos;t . It either 1 ) reflects the views of the majority or 2 ) reflects the views of a single person ( which can either help or hurt the minority ) . In the age of the living constitution ( which is what substantive due process created by the way ) a decision by the court on what something means today would have to be looked at through the eyes of the majority if you use this standard . You would have to say `` what does liberty mean ... well , it means what society wants it to mean ... which is the majority &apos;&apos; . Either that or a judge would be like `` hey , I think abortion is wrong ... it must be against liberty &apos;&apos; . Either way , you might hurt the minority ... such as the Kelo case or in some `` due process &apos;&apos; cases regarding people accused on crimes . Do n&apos;t for a minute think that substantive due process will only help the minority ... as Scalia puts it , `` that is n&apos;t the name of the game &apos;&apos; . Surely in the first couple of years the framers would see whether or not the government was working the way intended ... it seems that since it was accepted for the first 150-200 years then that has more backing . Sure it is . If they interpret that making laws against smoking weed is in the constitution then they made a law against government making laws to promote smoking weed . In a sense , it is a ban on governing . Or by saying `` you have to provide an attorney and pay for it &apos;&apos; you created a law oh what the state must do ; they do n&apos;t get to interpret what is IN the constitution ... the get to interpret the constitution . You make it seem like the decide what is in or out ... that is already set in stone , it is a legal document . A contract to sell a car does n&apos;t have things implied in it like `` it should come with that new car smell &apos;&apos; ... that would be crazy . Sure it does . Everytime you did n&apos;t like something you could just say `` not included in liberty &apos;&apos; ... you make the Supreme Court the most powerful of all the branches and unchecked ... this was obviously not the intent of the framers nor the practice of the courts ( for 150 years ) . based on what ? You say the constitution but when asked where you say liberty ... who gets to decide liberty ... the judges ... what do they base it on ... the constitution ... what a crazy circle with no end . It really just comes down to it being based on the judges own personal views ... do you not agree ? So in a sense , we have no idea what the constitution says ... it all depends on the 9 people up there at any given moment . It literally is the only legal document that changes depending on who looks it . I ca n&apos;t imagine that happening with my lease for my apartment . The meaning could change any time . wow . It is your only logical conclusion ! Why would you not get the judges up there that have your viewpoint ! !

The research is to understand , who becomes a Creationist , why , where your from etc . . Your help is most appreciated . Please give basic background : Age , State of residence , Marital status , Education Level , Religious Affiliation , Occupation . What type of Creationist are you ? Examples : Flat Earthers - believe that the earth is flat and is covered by a solid dome or firmament . Waters above the firmament were the source of Noah &apos;s flood . This belief is based on a literal reading of the Bible , such as references to the `` four corners of the earth &apos;&apos; and the `` circle of the earth . &apos;&apos; Few people hold this extreme view , but some do . Geocentrism - accept a spherical earth but deny that the sun is the center of the solar system or that the earth moves . As with flat - earth views , the water of Noah &apos;s flood came from above a solid firmament . The basis for their belief is a literal reading of the Bible . `` It is not an interpretation at all , it is what the words say . &apos;&apos; ( Willis 2000 ) Both flat - earthers and geocentrists reflect the cosmological views of ancient Hebrews . Geocentrism is not common today , but one geocentrist ( Tom Willis ) was intrumental in revising the Kansas elementary school curriculum to remove references to evolution , earth history , and science methodology . Young Earth Creationists - claim a literal interpretation of the Bible as a basis for their beliefs . They believe that the earth is 6000 to 10,000 years old , that all life was created in six literal days , that death and decay came as a result of Adam &amp; Eve &apos;s Fall , and that geology must be interpreted in terms of Noah &apos;s Flood . However , they accept a spherical earth and heliocentric solar system . Old - Earth Creationists - accept the evidence for an ancient earth but still believe that life was specially created by God , and they still base their beliefs on the Bible . There are a few different ways of accomodating their religion with science . Day - age creationists - interpret each day of creation as a long period of time , even thousands or millions of years . They see a parallel between the order of events presented in Genesis 1 and the order accepted by mainstream science . Day - Age Creationism was more popular than Gap Creationism in the 19th and and early 20th centuries . Evolutionary Creationism - differs from Theistic Evolution only in its theology , not in its science . It says that God operates not in the gaps , but that nature has no existence independent of His will . It allows interpretations consistent with both a literal Genesis and objective science , allowing , for example , that the events of creation occurred , but not in time as we know it , and that Adam was not the first biological human but the first spiritually aware one . Theistic Evolution - says that God creates through evolution . Theistic Evolutionists vary in beliefs about how much God intervenes in the process . It accepts most or all of modern science , but it invokes God for some things outside the realm of science , such as the creation of the human soul . This position is promoted by the Pope and taught at mainline Protestant seminaries . Materialistic Evolution - differs from Theistic Evolution in saying that God does not actively interfere with evolution . It is not necessarily atheistic , though ; many Materialistic Evolutionists believe that God created evolution , for example . Materialistic evolution may be divided into methodological and philosophical materialism . Methodological materialism limits itself to describing the natural world with natural causes ; it says nothing at all about the supernatural , neither affirming nor denying its existence or its role in life . Philosophical materialism - says that the supernatural does not exist . It says that not only is evolution a natural process , but so is everything else . Vedic Creationism Hinduism speaks of a very ancient earth . One book influenced by Hindu belief argues that anatomically modern humans have existed for billions of years .

Examples : Flat Earthers - believe that the earth is flat and is covered by a solid dome or firmament . Waters above the firmament were the source of Noah &apos;s flood . This belief is based on a literal reading of the Bible , such as references to the `` four corners of the earth &apos;&apos; and the `` circle of the earth . &apos;&apos; Few people hold this extreme view , but some do . Geocentrism - accept a spherical earth but deny that the sun is the center of the solar system or that the earth moves . As with flat - earth views , the water of Noah &apos;s flood came from above a solid firmament . The basis for their belief is a literal reading of the Bible . `` It is not an interpretation at all , it is what the words say . &apos;&apos; ( Willis 2000 ) Both flat - earthers and geocentrists reflect the cosmological views of ancient Hebrews . Geocentrism is not common today , but one geocentrist ( Tom Willis ) was intrumental in revising the Kansas elementary school curriculum to remove references to evolution , earth history , and science methodology . Young Earth Creationists - claim a literal interpretation of the Bible as a basis for their beliefs . They believe that the earth is 6000 to 10,000 years old , that all life was created in six literal days , that death and decay came as a result of Adam &amp; Eve &apos;s Fall , and that geology must be interpreted in terms of Noah &apos;s Flood . However , they accept a spherical earth and heliocentric solar system . Old - Earth Creationists - accept the evidence for an ancient earth but still believe that life was specially created by God , and they still base their beliefs on the Bible . There are a few different ways of accomodating their religion with science . Day - age creationists - interpret each day of creation as a long period of time , even thousands or millions of years . They see a parallel between the order of events presented in Genesis 1 and the order accepted by mainstream science . Day - Age Creationism was more popular than Gap Creationism in the 19th and and early 20th centuries . Evolutionary Creationism - differs from Theistic Evolution only in its theology , not in its science . It says that God operates not in the gaps , but that nature has no existence independent of His will . It allows interpretations consistent with both a literal Genesis and objective science , allowing , for example , that the events of creation occurred , but not in time as we know it , and that Adam was not the first biological human but the first spiritually aware one . Theistic Evolution - says that God creates through evolution . Theistic Evolutionists vary in beliefs about how much God intervenes in the process . It accepts most or all of modern science , but it invokes God for some things outside the realm of science , such as the creation of the human soul . This position is promoted by the Pope and taught at mainline Protestant seminaries . Materialistic Evolution - differs from Theistic Evolution in saying that God does not actively interfere with evolution . It is not necessarily atheistic , though ; many Materialistic Evolutionists believe that God created evolution , for example . Materialistic evolution may be divided into methodological and philosophical materialism . Methodological materialism limits itself to describing the natural world with natural causes ; it says nothing at all about the supernatural , neither affirming nor denying its existence or its role in life . Philosophical materialism - says that the supernatural does not exist . It says that not only is evolution a natural process , but so is everything else . Vedic Creationism Hinduism speaks of a very ancient earth . One book influenced by Hindu belief argues that anatomically modern humans have existed for billions of years .

The study , reported in an edition of the journal Science , does little to settle the issue of whether there is a gene on the X chromosome that predisposes men to homosexuality . Men inherit their single X chromosome from their mothers . The gene was first predicted in 1993 based on studies of families with two gay brothers . `` The initial finding has n&apos;t been disproven , but it probably has n&apos;t been replicated to most people &apos;s satisfaction , &apos;&apos; said Alan Sanders , a psychiatrist and geneticist at the University of Chicago . `` Maybe it will be , and maybe it wo n&apos;t be . &apos;&apos; Dean Hamer , the scientist who first reported the connection , criticized the new study for not using families where homosexuality predominated on the mother &apos;s side . The researchers , argued Hamer , of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Md. , were making it harder on themselves to find the gene . Several studies have supported the idea that genetics plays a role in homosexuality . But scientists say genetics can not be the whole story . For example , some gay men have an identical twin who is gay , and other gay men have an identical twin who is not gay . The term `` gay gene &apos;&apos; is misleading , scientists say , because there are likely to be many subtle genetic influences on sexual orientation . In the 1993 research , Hamer and his colleagues studied the genetic makeup of 40 families . As the researchers reported then in Science , genetic features on a region of the X chromosome tended to correlate with homosexual orientation . A 1995 study by the same researchers also suggested the link . An actual predisposing gene in the region has not been reported . The result was intriguing to many people . Some thought the study supported the notion that homosexuality is not a choice . But many scientists were cautious about saying Hamer &apos;s findings meant the `` gay gene &apos;&apos; really existed . While geneticists are adept at finding genes that cause clear - cut conditions , such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis , it has been much harder to pin down genes that underlie more complex traits . For instance , scientists know that certain disorders , such as schizophrenia and manic depression , have a genetic component . But they have not been able to pin down the culprit genes . That &apos;s probably because many genes , as well as other influences , contribute to the disorders . Scientists do n&apos;t put much stock in any one study unless other studies find the same result . `` The replication of a genetic finding in these behavioral ( traits ) is very difficult , &apos;&apos; said Melvin McInnis , a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore . Sexual orientation is likely to be just as complicated , he said . The result of the new study - by George Rice , George Ebers and Carol Anderson at the University of Western Ontario and Neil Risch at Stanford Medical School in California - does n&apos;t mean the first study was incorrect . Although the new study examined the same spot on the X chromosome in 104 gay men , it was done on different people . It could be , McInnis said , that an X chromosome gene is at work in the first group of people but not the second . Sanders has also tried to replicate the findings of Hamer , although his results have not appeared in a scientific journal . He said his study was more in the middle - it did n&apos;t replicate Hamer &apos;s findings , but it did n&apos;t exclude the possibility as strongly as the new study did . The only way to solve the problem is to study more people , the scientists said . Even then , if there is an effect of a gene on the X chromosome , scientists may never be able to pinpoint it if the effect is very small , Sanders said . http://www.gaytostraight.org/downloads/chapter2.pdf",,40200,"Exactly !

The study , reported in an edition of the journal Science , does little to settle the issue of whether there is a gene on the X chromosome that predisposes men to homosexuality . Men inherit their single X chromosome from their mothers . The gene was first predicted in 1993 based on studies of families with two gay brothers . `` The initial finding has n&apos;t been disproven , but it probably has n&apos;t been replicated to most people &apos;s satisfaction , &apos;&apos; said Alan Sanders , a psychiatrist and geneticist at the University of Chicago . `` Maybe it will be , and maybe it wo n&apos;t be . &apos;&apos; Dean Hamer , the scientist who first reported the connection , criticized the new study for not using families where homosexuality predominated on the mother &apos;s side . The researchers , argued Hamer , of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Md. , were making it harder on themselves to find the gene . Several studies have supported the idea that genetics plays a role in homosexuality . But scientists say genetics can not be the whole story . For example , some gay men have an identical twin who is gay , and other gay men have an identical twin who is not gay . The term `` gay gene &apos;&apos; is misleading , scientists say , because there are likely to be many subtle genetic influences on sexual orientation . In the 1993 research , Hamer and his colleagues studied the genetic makeup of 40 families . As the researchers reported then in Science , genetic features on a region of the X chromosome tended to correlate with homosexual orientation . A 1995 study by the same researchers also suggested the link . An actual predisposing gene in the region has not been reported . The result was intriguing to many people . Some thought the study supported the notion that homosexuality is not a choice . But many scientists were cautious about saying Hamer &apos;s findings meant the `` gay gene &apos;&apos; really existed . While geneticists are adept at finding genes that cause clear - cut conditions , such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis , it has been much harder to pin down genes that underlie more complex traits . For instance , scientists know that certain disorders , such as schizophrenia and manic depression , have a genetic component . But they have not been able to pin down the culprit genes . That &apos;s probably because many genes , as well as other influences , contribute to the disorders . Scientists do n&apos;t put much stock in any one study unless other studies find the same result . `` The replication of a genetic finding in these behavioral ( traits ) is very difficult , &apos;&apos; said Melvin McInnis , a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore .

Although the new study examined the same spot on the X chromosome in 104 gay men , it was done on different people . It could be , McInnis said , that an X chromosome gene is at work in the first group of people but not the second . Sanders has also tried to replicate the findings of Hamer , although his results have not appeared in a scientific journal . He said his study was more in the middle - it did n&apos;t replicate Hamer &apos;s findings , but it did n&apos;t exclude the possibility as strongly as the new study did .

Without interference and help from the outside the exploitation would have ended long ago from internal forces that normally can not deal with both internal and external forces at the same time . Look at Iran , during the 1950 , a democratic , and nationalistic government was voted into power , external forces ( the US and UK ) interfered and caused its collapse and reinstated the Shah . The Shah stayed in power only because of external support . When the support stopped his rule ended , and because of his brutal civil rights record ( very similar to Saddams during that time frame ) a fundamentalist government took power as a reaction to the Shah . Had the Democratic nation not been overthrown I seriously doubt a fundamentalist government would have rosen to power 26 years later .",,98926,"Generally speaking , low . From what I understand they generally have an over achieving area of the brain that leads to some overachievement in whatever functions that area contributes to . Like numbers , music , visuals/art , etc . . Because they lack the raw intelligence and social skills , they seem to be able to neither achieve easily in society , nor contribute more than extraordinary duplication or `` functions &apos;&apos; , without much ( or any ) creative ability or ability to apply their skills without assistance to society . Calculating prime numbers in the millions in seconds , in your head , or playing an entire song from memory after hearing it once , is amazing , no doubt , but they are task oriented , not really pushing the frontier of those disciplines .

As of today , the law of our nation will acknowledge the plain fact that crimes of violence against a pregnant woman often have two victims , &apos;&apos; Bush said before the signing of the measure . `` The death of an innocent unborn child has too often been treated as a detail in one crime but not a crime in itself , &apos;&apos; the president said . The Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( search ) makes it a crime to harm a fetus during an assault on a pregnant woman . Bush signed the bill , which took five years to get through Congress , in an elaborate Rose Garden ceremony . Raw Data : Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( FindLaw ) The controversial measure , which gained new support following the 2002 murder of a pregnant Laci Peterson ( search ) , is also called `` Laci and Conner &apos;s law . &apos;&apos; The California woman was eight months pregnant with a son who was to be named Conner when she disappeared on Christmas Eve . Laci Peterson &apos;s husband , Scott Peterson ( search ) , has been charged with murder . California is one of 29 states with fetus protection laws . `` All who knew Laci Peterson have mourned two deaths and the law can not look away and pretend there was just one , &apos;&apos; Bush said . Standing behind Bush in the East Room of the White House were a number of prominent lawmakers and people whose pregnant daughters had been slain . Bush focused on one family in particular : that of Laci Peterson . `` All who knew Laci Peterson have mourned two deaths and the law can not look away and pretend there is just one , &apos;&apos; Bush said . `` They have laid to rest their daughter , Laci , a beautiful young woman who was joyfully awaiting the arrival of a new son ... This little soul never saw light but he is loved and he is remembered and his name is forever enjoined with that of his mother . &apos;&apos; The bill only applies during commission of federal crimes , such as a terrorist attack or drug - related shooting , and only when it is being committed against the pregnant mother . The bill defines an `` unborn child &apos;&apos; as a child in utero , which means `` a member of the species homo sapiens , at any stage of development , who is carried in the womb . &apos;&apos; That definition angers abortion rights supporters , who say the legislation defines life as starting at the point of conception and therefore confers person - status to the fetus . They add that the law will threaten a woman &apos;s right to choose . `` The bill President Bush has signed into law today is yet another example of the misleading tactics that opponents of a woman &apos;s right to choose are willing to employ , &apos;&apos; Vicki Saporta , president of the National Abortion Federation ( search ) , said in a statement . `` The bill &apos;s supporters claim they are trying to protect women from violence , yet they refused to allow any real violence prevention measures , or even aid to victims , into the bill . &apos;&apos; The bill specifically states that legal abortions are not a crime , but critics fear the way it defines life could provide a legal precedent for those who would outlaw the procedure . The Senate narrowly rejected an amendment by Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif . , that would have imposed the same penalties on assailants without referring to the legal status of a fetus . `` This law rights a blatant and indefensible wrong by establishing what everyone already knows - that these children were here , &apos;&apos; House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( search ) , R - Texas , said in a statement . `` With the president &apos;s signature , common sense and common decency are finally placed into law . &apos;&apos; Abortion opponents welcome the law as a step toward more protections for the unborn . Bush said he supported the legislation though he did not think the country was headed toward banning abortions . Bush has said he opposes abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when pregnancy endangers a woman &apos;s life .

Rate the formality of sentences,Read 10 sentences and determine how formal/informal each is,"research, English, language",7,111965,"Basically , ` liberal &apos;s &apos; do n&apos;t think the fetus is ` alive &apos; and thus see nothing wrong in expelling it . Conservatives think differently . An impass . Many just ca n&apos;t grasp the notion ... even if it &apos;s heavily laden in verbage used that both sides view the ` fetus &apos; differently . IMO , most arguements between the 2 camps get no where . As to Duo Maxwell and others ^ , ever been behind bars ? Even in America ? Not exactly a walk in the park but , closer to a walk down a dark street in a bad part of town . Most would n&apos;t want to be there if given another choice but it really is n&apos;t that bad . It &apos;s something you can get used to . I &apos; ve personally been on both sides of the ` prison &apos; thing . Prison is full of people who often think they &apos; re getting a fairly decent deal . Only thing is trying to figure out what to do with your time to entertain yourself . Conservatives want to ` punish &apos; people who do wrong . Liberals often want to rehabilitate them or simply remove them peacefully from society so they can do no further harm . But , punishment can be too harsh and some can appear rehabilitarted or find a way to get back into society to cause more harm . I personally think we should sent them to a near inescapable penal colony . Yeah , some place inhospitableish . We can call it Australia . ;) Also , the economic proofs used to oppose the death penalty are about as weak as you can get . The simple matter of the disparity in the figures comes from the thoroughness used in most death penalty cases . More is placed on something believed to be permanent that they want to make sure they &apos; re doing it right . When the notion is that they &apos; re just going to lock you up ( for a LONG period of time ) they ( judicial system ) really do n&apos;t give much of a * * * * and will stick you with a craptacular public defender if you ca n&apos;t afford one yourself . Thus , the cost is lower . So , I personally do n&apos;t pay much heed in using financial issues in dealing with justice issues . Morality and other issues , I &apos; ll listen to but some one saying it &apos;s cheaper to kangaroo court some poor schmuck into a lengthy prison sentance over a viscious homocide rather than spend the time , money and effort to ensure that he &apos;s as guilty as you think is pretty pathetic . * Almost like how a liberal will bemoan a corporations concearn for it &apos;s share holders over thinking of the damage it does to the environment and shoddly product it pushes onto consumers . Bean counting . It &apos;s the same thing . * Unless I &apos; m making the statement , then , of course , it &apos;s complety rational and good . Teehee , pretty large claim there however it &apos;s not a literal claim just like the bad hair day comment . VOC is n&apos;t a good debator since his points are meandering and generic . However , do consider there was a recent case where a woman refused a Cesarian in the US for rather selfish issues and caused the death of one of her twins she was carring . So , such extrapolation is n&apos;t too hard to believe . So , yes , in the realm of 40 millionish abortions in the US , it &apos;s not too hard to believe that a woman would have an abortion for such a silly reason . Hell , people murder citizens ( living grown people ) for less . ... Are YOU looking at me funny ? Blam . ... She stole my shampoo ! STAB . ... I &apos; m too lazy and cheap to get a divorce ( quite a few murders ) . ... Want to get even with your wife ... kill the living baby . ... Ummm ... Idonno ... I just kilt em . So , if someone does n&apos;t think the unborn is living and is chemically imbalanced ( such things happen with pregnancies ) , it &apos;s plausabile to think one would abort a fetus for really any fricking reason imaginable . We &apos; re human after all . We do lots of things for dumb reasons . Hold on a sec ... Yep , that chic I went to high school got an abortion because she got a ticket for running a red light . emoticon_rolleyes You know why you ca n&apos;t find much in the way of documented reasons on why people get an abortion ? It &apos;s because they do n&apos;t tell and most people do n&apos;t ask . And most of what &apos;s presented is often hearsay . Something quite different than when you &apos; re pushed infront of some detectives and actually questioned over your motives for murdering someone . You &apos; re too cute . Post links , ask someone to spend time refuting them then promise to bury them with more of the same if they do ... almost like telling them not to even bother . What are you ?

Conservatives think differently . An impass . Many just ca n&apos;t grasp the notion ... even if it &apos;s heavily laden in verbage used that both sides view the ` fetus &apos; differently . IMO , most arguements between the 2 camps get no where . As to Duo Maxwell and others ^ , ever been behind bars ? Even in America ?

It &apos;s something you can get used to . I &apos; ve personally been on both sides of the ` prison &apos; thing . Prison is full of people who often think they &apos; re getting a fairly decent deal . Only thing is trying to figure out what to do with your time to entertain yourself . Conservatives want to ` punish &apos; people who do wrong . Liberals often want to rehabilitate them or simply remove them peacefully from society so they can do no further harm . But , punishment can be too harsh and some can appear rehabilitarted or find a way to get back into society to cause more harm . I personally think we should sent them to a near inescapable penal colony . Yeah , some place inhospitableish . We can call it Australia . ;) Also , the economic proofs used to oppose the death penalty are about as weak as you can get .

Also , it is not entirely clear that encouraging this view of our relationship is to our benefit as long as our status in the U.S. is unequal . I can , however , see why some couples would pursue a Canadian marriage . If the couple sees the possibility of emigration to Canada , it would make sense , I think ( I &apos; m not a lawyer , so I could well be wrong ) . For those who travel to Canada and face some sort of medical issue , I can imagine that it would also be prudent . In the case of Massachusetts , once the issue of Romney &apos;s shameful use of a segregationist law to prevent marriages between non - residents has been settled , I woud consider getting married there . I can imagine all sorts of scenarios in which I might want the option to move to Boston and be seen as married for legal purposes ( even if the way they drive there terrifies me ) . I probably would go get married there if I could , because I &apos; m pretty confident that that marriage would eventually be recognized where I do live and , in time , across the country . There are quite a few situations in which the length of time one has been married is relevant .",,416214,"YouTube - It Gets Better : Bishop Mark Hanson , ELCA",,142510,"If you deliberately made the stick pointy , and carried it , you &apos; d be in all kinds of trouble .

The theory of Evolution in science , just like many other theories in biology ( germs and viruses , DNA , ... ) , are mostly proven and approved . These theories are used and often said to be true .

The huge majority of people are heterosexual . Marriage since time immemorial has been about being between people of opposite genders If on the otherhand the vast majority were homosexual then we would probably have much the same as the homosexual population would have died out leaving the heterosexual community around,,31770,"Draconis re : How I Understand Time , I also enjoy physics , and have a huge stack of new physics books upstairs , and a neat physics encyclopedia that I know the answer is in ... but I &apos; d rather take a shot at it , and be wrong , and learn from someone who can come up with a definitive answer . Lest I get up off my lazy XXX , and grab that book and type it out for us . Anyway ... I know that time stops at light speed . And one of the neat little threads I often put up in Science Forums is how you can travel 100,000 light years instantaneously . Actually , you can be at ANY point in the universe SIMULTANEOUSLY , and instantly , when you are travelling at light speed . But , I &apos; m just avoiding answering the question ... When does time stop . OK . My understanding of time is that it exists in any `` system &apos;&apos; in which the most elementry particles of matter are in motion . What I also recall is that the condition necessary For Time To Stop ... is an infinitely large ( inward ) gravitational force towards a single point , such as inside a Black Hole . What I recall about When Time Stops ... is when all matter is at complete rest ... i.e. no electrons are weaving around , nothing in or outside that matter is in motion , nor vibrating ... ( the in motion part I &apos; m not sure of ... if it includes in motion relative to all other matter in the universe , or in motion relative to the `` system &apos;&apos; being considered . My guess is the latter for a limited `` system &apos;&apos; , but the former , if speaking of the time for the entire universe . ) So it is my understanding that if the system you are referring to is just a specific Black Hole , then inside that Black Hole , Time has stopped ... However , if we are speaking of the entire Universe , as the `` system &apos;&apos; under consideration for when time stops ... Then we are talking about when all the matter in the Universe has gathered together into a single `` mass &apos;&apos; , so that no matter exists outside of it , and again , there is a Big Black hole ... But . . my understanding is that there is at least one theory that believes it is possible that when all of the matter in the Universe collapses ( if it ever does collapse again ) , that it may undergo a phase transition into pure energy , as I understand it , it &apos;s would be like some kind of light , and energy plasma with a huge amount of heat , and then that stuff transitions again into matter , explodes in the Big One , and POOF , Time Starts again . Anyway ... that &apos;s as best as I can recall it ... UNLESS you are Travelling at Light Speed , in which case Time Will Stop , for you . I also recall one other thing , that Einstein &apos;s equation E = M * C ^ 2 Is not a correct representation of Einstein &apos;s ACTUAL Equation , and that the equation is actially : E = Mzero * C ^ 2 And that the M ( subscript zero ) refers to Rest Mass , Mass at Rest , whatever , but not the same thing as when we mistakenly write Einstein &apos;s equation as : E = M * C ^ 2 All of this stuff is from memory , and as I said , I &apos; ve not yet had time to get into the Physics stuff too deeply . . I &apos; m currently working my way into higher mathematics ... which I got another ton of super books on ... And that &apos;s gon na take me a few years , before I get through all of it , and into Physics !

I want your answers . You start the debate and I will end it . - John,,50066,"Multiculturalism is bunk , not because it advocates appreciating other cultures or because it encourages people to hold onto elements of their cultures . It is bunk because it demonizes traditional American culture and heritage , and it seeks to use the government to extinguish that traditional culture and install one instead that assumes that all cultures are equally valid except for the traditional American one which is wicked , and all cultures except the traditional American one should have an equal presence in the public sphere , creating a tower of Babel of ethnic conflict . I &apos; ve got an idea . Let &apos;s all move to Tonga and organize to snuff out Tongan culture by installing a multicultural society where we institute the cultures of Japan , Mexico , China , Loas , Pakistan , Zimbabwe , India , Indonesia , Ghana , El Salvador , Russia , Latvia , Taiwan , and a 100 others all equally , but most of the time our celebration will be spent discussing how horrible Tongan culture is , and is n&apos;t so wonderful we &apos; re getting rid of that for our multicultural paradise .

Now that Obama has acknowledged having had Kenyan citizenship , it &apos;s time to take another serious look at his recent campaign activities on behalf of Kenyan presidential candidate Raila Odinga , a Muslim sympathizer and leader of the socialist Orange Democratic Movement . We review the Obama - Odinga campaign collaboration with this central question in mind : As a former Kenyan citizen , does Obama &apos;s open involvement in Kenyan presidential politics raise troubling questions about his loyalties ? Apparently Obama traveled to Kenya on official business as a US Senator ; the trip was funded by US taxpayers . Odinga &apos;s policy positions were against stated US interests . Odinga , running on the slogan `` Agent of Change , &apos;&apos; lost the race for President of Kenya in December 2007 and thereafter led a campaign of widespread ethnic warfare in protest of his loss . In August 2007 , Odinga had signed an agreement with Islamic extremists to institute Islamic Law should he be elected President of Kenya , and he vowed to end cooperation with the United States in the war against terror . WHY did OBAMA actively campaign for him ? The TD Blog initiated a review of the Constitutional problems related to Barack Obama &apos;s dual citizenship . His activities in Kenya illustrate how dual citizenship can create divided loyalties and thus disqualify a candidate for Commander - in-Chief of the United States . [ Incidentally , this is also a clear - cut violation of the Logan Act -- see our article in the Reference List at the end . ] This central question is now being litigated by Philip J. Berg . Whether or not Berg &apos;s case prevails on the procedural issues of standing and jurisdiction - the issue of dual citizenship must eventually be reviewed by the federal courts . In the event that Obama gets elected , I predict that this legal problem will ultimately end his presidency . What a shame that he &apos;s been so secretive and deceptive about his past .

No , it leads to evolutionists thinking that all things come from evolution , love , business , philosophy , even religion . Like you attempting earlier , in very vague terms , about love .

Somehow immaterial things came from material things . I believe in God because I am witness to God . I do n&apos;t believe in God for purely speculative reasons . I am witness to His calling , His miracles , His testimony . You are the one who does n&apos;t believe in God because there &apos;s no proof because you only accept the proofs that ca n&apos;t prove God !

It &apos;s in your re - construction of what I believe - that I believe in God , and you ca n&apos;t because you do n&apos;t accept any evidences except materialistic ones which ca n&apos;t prove God . Now there &apos;s the irony ! What has ` higher thinking &apos; got to do with free will ? Are you saying that a slug does n&apos;t have free will ? Or that a whale which does have higher thinking , has free will ? But you exhibit the circular reasoning again . Higher thinking enables survival ! A slug does n&apos;t have the brains we do , yet survives . Everything survives because of evolution is what you &apos; re saying ... whether it has higher thinking , or not . Everything just is , because of evolution ! Higher thinking , lower thinking , no thinking , all enable survival , because they all survive . Why is it that we have ` free will &apos; and not some insect - like communal system where - by the individual is under the will of the general good ? That &apos;s another odd thing you have to face up to , all your dreams , desires etc , are from evolution . You are just a mess of chemicals . I do have evidence for the existence of God . I have been witness to His miracles and His calling . Sure , it &apos;s not scientific evidence . And sure , you wo n&apos;t therefore accept it , but then you actually only believe this circular reasoning when its convenient . Unless you &apos; ve actually seen an atom - I expect you accept the witness statements of other scientists on this . No , once again you only believe in materialist evidences , which can never prove God , therefore you have no evidence for God . Yet you believe in immaterial things such as ` Beauty &apos; . Unless you can show me the scientific proofs for ` beauty &apos; . You &apos; re only selective in when you apply your circular reasoning , which is still illogical . So you &apos; re saying that if a gene changes , that &apos;s evolution . What about that caused by radiation say , from fall - out ?

I will suggest that you absolutely should agree to grant liberty and equal rights to people who perform an action that is absolutely harmless . What reasoning justifies the use of the word `` could &apos;&apos; ? Anyhow , you mentioned that it ca n&apos;t be proven that legalizing same - sex marriage is harmless , but I do n&apos;t think that is important . It ca n&apos;t be proven that many things are harmless , for example . It ca n&apos;t be proven that opposite - sex marriage is harmless , it ca n&apos;t be proven that alcohol use is harmless , it ca n&apos;t be proven that airbags or seatbelts are harmless , even . There might be some unforseen harm in same - sex marriage , but if that harm can not be listed or spoken of , then we have no right banning same - sex marriage . Disallowing something based on the opinion that there is probably some harm , without actually listing that harm , is not an action of a free government , it is the action of a tyrannical government . This implies that the government has the right to ban things even if there is no speakable reason for banning them . What I mean is , I can argue that same - sex marriage brings no harm . In fact , I will state that right now . But such an argument is hard to make if no possible harms of same - sex marriage are listed . Without a list of possible harms of same - sex marriage , I &apos; d have to go through an infinite list of harms and prove why each one does not apply to same - sex marriage . I &apos; d have to assume that same - sex marriage causes every possible harm then prove that harm wrong . But a free society does not ban something until it can be absolutely proven harmless , a free society assumes that an action is acceptable unless a harm can be listed . In light of this , I would like you to list some possible harms of same - sex marriage so that this harm can be debated . Furthermore , even if same - sex marriage were not harmless ( which I still claim that it is ) , that would not be enough reason to ban the activity . That harm would have to be weighed up against the many benefits of same - sex marriage to determine whether the harm outweighs the benefits or not . These benefits include : - Freedom of people to marry who they choose - Greater equality under the law - Better homes for children in adoption facilities - Eased financial burden on same - sex couples - Encouragement of family unit which provides emotional and financial support in times where one member is in need - Setting a precendent of preventing government from interfering in the personal lives of citizens - Expanding health care coverage partners of same - sex couples and their children If any harms of same - sex marriage could not overcome those benefits ( and any others that might be brought up ) , then same - sex marriage should be legalized , even if it could not be said to be harmless .",,256604,It is called heterosexual privledge .,,169433,"Diogenes99 , you are quoting my words but assigning them to Platypus :) Some of the things you are replying to belong to Platypus . It was left to the States . However , when a citizen of the State challenges State law , the case is under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court ( read Article III ) . They then have the authority to decide whether the State law is Constitutional . They decided it was not in Roe . Post # 35 was Platypus ;) Try to keep up I do know this . You keep missing my point , the Constitution did not forbid either group from having full rights ( with the possible exception of counting slaves as 3/5ths of a person ) . Neither group is analogous to a fetus not having rights , because a fetus does n&apos;t even meet the criteria while both women and blacks do . That womenwere prevented by State laws is besides the point , and any laws preventing them should have been struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional . What are you talking about ? How is the Equal Protection Clause and saying that women should have the law applied equally to them as to men assigning words whatever meaning suits my purpose ? `` Section 1 . All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . &apos;&apos; Are you seriously suggesting that stating women should have equal rights to vote under this is invalid ?

We are . There are certainly other factors at work , but that does nto excuse our participation . AFIK , nobody has argued that the Kyoto treaty would entirely reign in global warming . Even if we stopped all greehouse gas emissions RIGHT NOW , it would be another several thousand years before the excess buildup in our atmosphere has been dealt with . Those increased levels would continue to haunt us . What the Kyoto treaty aimed to do was to diminish the effect of human greehouse gas emissions . The idea was that doing SOMETHING is preferable to doing NOTHING . I have to say I agree with this . As I see it , a large portion of the global warming thing and greenhouse gasses is one of timing . There are certainly cyclic changes in the earths climate . If we were on a downward trend , greenhouse gas emissions would not be such a problem . We are not , though . We are on an upward trend , and the production of greenhouse gasses can only serve to accelerate the problem .

I will suggest that you absolutely should agree to grant liberty and equal rights to people who perform an action that is absolutely harmless . What reasoning justifies the use of the word `` could &apos;&apos; ? Anyhow , you mentioned that it ca n&apos;t be proven that legalizing same - sex marriage is harmless , but I do n&apos;t think that is important . It ca n&apos;t be proven that many things are harmless , for example . It ca n&apos;t be proven that opposite - sex marriage is harmless , it ca n&apos;t be proven that alcohol use is harmless , it ca n&apos;t be proven that airbags or seatbelts are harmless , even . There might be some unforseen harm in same - sex marriage , but if that harm can not be listed or spoken of , then we have no right banning same - sex marriage . Disallowing something based on the opinion that there is probably some harm , without actually listing that harm , is not an action of a free government , it is the action of a tyrannical government . This implies that the government has the right to ban things even if there is no speakable reason for banning them . What I mean is , I can argue that same - sex marriage brings no harm . In fact , I will state that right now . But such an argument is hard to make if no possible harms of same - sex marriage are listed . Without a list of possible harms of same - sex marriage , I &apos; d have to go through an infinite list of harms and prove why each one does not apply to same - sex marriage . I &apos; d have to assume that same - sex marriage causes every possible harm then prove that harm wrong . But a free society does not ban something until it can be absolutely proven harmless , a free society assumes that an action is acceptable unless a harm can be listed . In light of this , I would like you to list some possible harms of same - sex marriage so that this harm can be debated . Furthermore , even if same - sex marriage were not harmless ( which I still claim that it is ) , that would not be enough reason to ban the activity . That harm would have to be weighed up against the many benefits of same - sex marriage to determine whether the harm outweighs the benefits or not . These benefits include : - Freedom of people to marry who they choose - Greater equality under the law - Better homes for children in adoption facilities - Eased financial burden on same - sex couples - Encouragement of family unit which provides emotional and financial support in times where one member is in need - Setting a precendent of preventing government from interfering in the personal lives of citizens - Expanding health care coverage partners of same - sex couples and their children If any harms of same - sex marriage could not overcome those benefits ( and any others that might be brought up ) , then same - sex marriage should be legalized , even if it could not be said to be harmless .",,256604,It is called heterosexual privledge .,,169433,"Diogenes99 , you are quoting my words but assigning them to Platypus :) Some of the things you are replying to belong to Platypus .

I &apos; m afraid that in this day and age , once any American president reaches his 6th or 7th year in office , he &apos;s a different person than he was when he took office , the corruption has simply taken over . It seems like so many people do n&apos;t recognize the importance of that statement , like alternate energy sources are right around the bend . Ethanol has been a miserable failure - there &apos;s nothing on the horizon that can replace oil quickly . The only way oil can be replaced without a complete crash of the U.S. government is for it to happen very gradually . The U.S. government is totally dependent on the millions of dollars per second that it takes in in gasoline/diesel taxes . Whatever replaces petroleum is going to have to be efficient enough to start out with heavy taxation . I can see it sucessfully happening only if the new source replaces petroleum far slower than petroleum products replaced the horse . If there would have been a huge taxation on hay in 1900 , it would n&apos;t have worked like it did .",,405978,"Bryan , thanks for that example . Very instructive . Like Nato says , if this passes Constitutional muster , all they have to do is raise the insurance requirement to something no one can afford ! So how much should it cost American citizens to participate in their Constitutional Rights ? The poor are left out of participating yet again ? That ca n&apos;t be allowed ?",,13410,"OK , first of all , both sides are overreacting I think . Some points are right , and some are n&apos;t . I &apos; m just going to address a few though . # 9 . Fun Fact : the `` reform &apos;&apos; of accounting laws that allowed Enron/Worldcom to happen in the first place was done by , you guessed it ( no you did n&apos;t ) , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( D - CT ) . I never liked him . 13 . The most corrupt presidency in recent memory is neither Bush nor Clinton , but Reagon . Clinton &apos;s administration had 1 felony conviction , Reagon had 30 ( and you know my opinion on the relative moral weight of lying about adultry vs. lying about selling weapons to terrorists ) . Clinton had his moral issues , but so does Bush . The Halliburton no - bid awarding , the Uranium scandal , John Ashcroft &apos;s every other move . bottom line , every politician sucks :) 14 . 1 ) the supreme court was dead wrong . democracy does n&apos;t have a time limit . If I took an entire state &apos;s ballot boxes hostage ( with the heavily armed militia I keep in my backyard :) ) , and hang on until January , do we just disenfranchise that state ? No , I would say that we value democracy more than that . but I suppose Antonin `` there is no right to vote &apos;&apos; Scalia disagrees . 2 ) I firmly believe , ( and the newspaper recounting reports supports this ) that more people , in the state of Florida , walked out of that ballot box BELIEVING they had voted for Al Gore . Whether or not Gore &apos;s chose recount process would have revealed that , I do n&apos;t know ( m &apos;m doubtful ) . But from the reports I &apos; ve seen and read , I am not doubtful of that fact . 3 ) the PROCESS in Florida was slanted and inconsistant . Basically , there should have been one of two scenarios . 1 ) We use a strict standard that only ballots which actually meet the stringent state requirements are counted . No `` hanging chads &apos;&apos; no `` voter intent . &apos;&apos; RESULT : illegitimately modified absentee/military ballots on the panhandle are thrown out , Gore wins ( they were more than enough to make up the gap , even w.out the other recounts ) . 2 ) We use a loose standard , trying to find voter intent . RESULT : Gore wins again . net 20,000 vote gain from Lake county alone via overvotes gives him the victory . ( the ballots were clearly for Gore . The voters often marked `` Gore &apos;&apos; on the box , then wrote `` Gore &apos;&apos; again on the line `` Write candiate &apos;s name here &apos;&apos; which was intended for write in candidates , but which many voters apparently thought was a fail - safe mechanism .
